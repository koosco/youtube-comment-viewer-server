By far the most saddest breakup song she's written. There's no angst, anger or sass. It's just raw heartbreak, sadness. A slow death. And ofc the medical nuance of the heartbeats and "you're losing me" is perfect. A masterpiece of a song.
I remember listening to this song and pondered on ending an engagement that turned domestically violent, tried relationship counseling, tried to get him in therapy and on medications & tried everything to get things to turn around. I sat in a corner and listened to this song and thought so deeply. At 21 you feel like you know nothing, but Taylor’s music describes my life experiences, helps me understand, analyze and feel my emotions . I left and sometimes months later I still think of him, but this song helps me cope ️ thank you Taylor for releasing this and congratulations on your accomplishments this year!!! I love you so much been a huge fan since 2006🫶!!! I loved your Denver night 2 show! 7/15!!!! Thank you for the best year!!!!!️️
I was in a 16 year relationship that was slowly killing me. This song saved me in May by showing me my relationship in a mirror. I'll forever love this song for helping me break out of unhappiness. Every line hit.
Took a long time but it was worth it! One of her best songs of all time!
No one was at fault here. They grew apart naturally but didn’t know how to let go because it had been so long. And clinging on made it worse. When it over, there’s nothing that can make it better. Once it’s done, it’s done. It’s not just about love, it’s more. Yes, you can fall out of love. Yes, as circumstances change, relationships change. I believe she loved him, but also that it was best and natural that it ended. That makes Lover, Reputation, the sister albums what they are, no lies in the moment, but in the context of the present reality, just a bit bittersweet. What a love story, Romeo and Juliet if they were real people and life drew them apart.
This is the song when “Tolerate it” finally pulling out the dagger. Taylor Swift brings out the unspoken painful things we had into words we couldn’t find ourselves.
TAYLOR SWIFT-  100%YOU'RE LOSING ME-  100%FROM THE VAULT- 100%VISUAL-  100%VOCALS-  100%CHORUS-  100%LYRICS-  100%  PRODUCTION-  100%INSTRUMENTAL-  100% TALENT-  100%INFLUENCE-  100%STYLE-  100%BEAUTY-  100% QUEEN-  100%SLAYED-  100%LET'S SHOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE AND SUPPORT OUR TAYLOR !!
“…I’m getting tired, even for a Phoenix…“ what a brilliant, creative, songwriter, poet, and lyricist Taylor is! Capturing the depth of internal experiences as she does… like this phrase… just wow!  Resonance for her listeners. Thank you, Taylor!
ylm es una completa obra de arte, de las canciones más profundamente dolorosas, y muy personal en realidad, el hecho de que haya puesto el latido de su corazón la hace muy especial, taylor siempre hace una fenomenal elegía, la amo <3
This is such a beautiful song gosh. Idk if I'm imagining it but at the end of when she says 'you're losing me', you can hear her voice shake and the heartbeat in the background I think talks about how she had hope in the initial stages even though she felt this way but at the end of the song the heartbeat stops like she knows it's time to go, But the heartbeat also adds to the anxiousness that she probably would've felt at the time of writing this song if that makes sense. This song breaks my heart in the best most beautiful way possible.
It's finally here! Thank you Taylor for expressing our feelings in your song again, it's truly a masterpiece 
She literally poured her heart in this song and let herself go emotionally to make this song. And she still chose to realease it, regardless of the leaks and the rumors… For the fans and for herself.Even the instrumental is well chosen, the sonar sound effect to mention that she lost the thing she has found before…You are a true artist Taylor.
Omgggg! I’m listening to this inside of my headphones, and omg the beats tho…. AHHHH IM SO HAPPY SHE UPLOADED IT!!! When I say I’m a swiftie, I mean it I only listen to Taylor
As someone who struggles with depression, I feel this song could easily be about that rather than a broken relationship. Sort of wish there would be a video along that vein. ️‍ Same with Castles Crumbling.
_LYRICS_ You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won'tRemember lookin' at this room?

Yes finally!! I can't get these lyrics out of my mind and now I can listen anytime I want  love you Tay
Thank you Taylor for finally releasing this! I waited for months! This song is so incredible and such a Masterpiece
The breath at the beginning of the song is such a good opening such a relatable feeling exhausted from trying to make something work when the other person isn’t trying. To me it is a continuous from tolerate it.; if you listen to one after another they really connect.
Uau. A Taylor nunca me decepciona!Wow. Taylor never disappointed me!
This is such a personal song and I'm so thankful she officially shared it with us
QUERO O RECAP LOGO PRA VER QUANTOS MINUTOS DE TAYLOR EU OUVI
This song...speaking for so many people letting go of a love that ran its course. Ugh. So good.
I presented on your impact on feminism with my friend today at an academic conference about you! You are such an inspiration and I love you and your music so much! I love all your music so much! Thank you for making my life better Taylor! 
I think that I've listened to this song dozens of times in the last couple of months, but just now realized something I don't think anyone pointed out before. Towards the beginning of the song, she said "My heart wont start anymore, for you" implicates that she's starting to lose feeling for him/losing faith in the relationship and begging him to do something about it before she lets go. But after all the struggle, he still decided to do nothing. So she walked away, and the song ends with the fading of the heart beat and "My heart wont start anymore", meaning that after walking away from him, she feels like she lost everything and without him, she's dead inside couldn't even find a heartbeat at all. Damn, this is so heart breaking :(
did anyone actually not know this song existed before now?it’s so iconic ngl🩵
MEU DEUS COMO ELA FOI LUZ NESSA MÚSICA
Como sempre arrasando nos hinos. 
Crazy how vault songs are literal masterpieces
Listening to this after 13 hours this masterpiece released everywhere
I just hope she knows she write the things that get me through the hardest times.
It sounds like there’s a heartbeat at the beginning and then when she says “ I can’t find a pulse” it goes away then comes back a little later. Love you Taylor and love the song so much️️
Thank you for giving us this masterpiece now to stream️
FINALLY!!! Thank you Taylor we love you so much I’m so happy I can listen to it on repeat
What wonderful music!! Taylor swift queen of pop, I'm Brazilian and I didn't like international music but after I started listening to Taylor, I love music in English, even more from Taylor 
Amo tanto essa
The sigh in the beginning does something to me! This is one of the most heartbreaking songs Taylor’s ever written. A masterpiece of PERFECTION! 🫶
I can't believe it's finally out... this is one of her saddest songs ever... and it makes sense because this was her longest relationship
REALMENTE TAYLOR TIENE UNA VOZ TAN LINDA,LA AMO MUCHO
Love it!! Already on repeat
OBRIGADO TAYLOR, TE AMAMOS
Ahh finally!  I love this one so much, especially the lyrics! Probably one of my favorites ever!  
I never thought she'd release this. I made a point of not listening to the leaked version, now this will be on repeat

escuché la canción filtrada durante un momento de la relación donde se sentía todo como ella lo describe. Ya salí de la relación y agradezco que la canción haya regresado a mi lista de reproducción, ya no duele tanto ️
One of my fave tracks  It finally made its way here. Thank you, TS.
I've never been on a relationship, but this song is devastating. It's a rollercoaster of sad emotions that keeps getting worse the more it progresses, until... It ends.There's this believing that music written on major key are always happy and music written on minor key is always sad or epic. Which makes sense, both keys fit the mood. But while Taylor has tons of songs that are on major key but they're really sad (like All Too Well), the chord progression chosen for this song just feels devastationg. One of the reasons I love Taylor is putting her emotions in her songs and this one is no exception, I just not feel sadness, I feel pain in this song. And the lyrics just make things worse, as always it's just perfection as expected from Taylor who is a poet. But every lyric just hits hard. As I said, I've never been on a relationship, but the fact that this song hits hard, shows how good can Taylor can transmit her emotions into her songs.
It's a song that snuggles up to my heartbreak.I thank you from the bottom of my heart
I love this song so much! Glad it has officially come out for streaming ️
What a great gift to wake up to!!! Happy early birthday Taylor!!!
Sometimes holding onto something you worked so hard to make work, hurts less than letting go. When the timing is right you’ll find that person that will want to marry you and accept you for the people pleaser that you are  don’t lower or change yourself or accept any less no matter what
Bella cancion ♡
Até que enfim Taylor!!!! Eu amei essa, estava na espera do lançamento oficial
Love it!!
ive never been in love but the emotion in her voice made me cry when i first listened, when it first dropped. Thank you Taylor for releasing it :)

A masterpiece. THE winter hit is here!
Essa mexe muito com minha cabeça
好好聽
I love this song, Taylor is such a queen
This whole song reflects my feeling towards my parents who do not see the damage they've done to me. I've about given up

Taylor im so proud of you like very very much. Letting go is hard but breathe in and breathe out you got this taylor you always had.ILY
te amo taylor sos una genia
Finally! I wondered yesterday when it would be available on streaming and here it is! 
FINALLY WE GET TO HEAR THIS MASTERPIECE
I bought the digital download but couldn’t find it on my device (tech idjit, lol) so thanks so much for this, Taylor. I can finally listen to it over and over!!
FINALMENTE ESSE HINO
hurts extra when you realise she went from writing king of my heart to her heart beat finally fading at the end of this song.   Sometimes relationships don't work out, it's better to leave than to hold onto something that is slowly destroying you :(
We thought she would announce rep tv today but instead she gave us this masterpiece!!! 
Such a lyrical masterpiece.
I love the contrast from when she sings "Do something babe, say something", like she's urgently begging him, and then you hear her in the background screaming it, "Say something!" with something more like anger at him for not trying to save the relationship.
AAAAAAA AMO ESTA CANCION AL FIN LA PUEDO ESCUCHAR TRANQUI
Gracias por este regalo, duele como el primer día pero no deja de ser maravilloso 
Hermosa cancion
The melody and acoustic of this Single are capable of speaking to the soul! ️
I was just scrolling finding songs and I find out she released this masterpiece
mommy taylor is the best medicine of the lovesick, broken, inlove and etc.i hope she could perform here in philippines i love her from the bottom of my heart and her cats too.

This song hits hard. I’m getting a divorce and damn. I feel this so hard. “Do I throw out everything or keep it?” So many times I convinced myself to stay with this question“Stop, you’re losing me” the time I said I didn’t know if I could forgive him leaving me alone to go to my grandmothers funeral and he still didn’t show up or try to be there for me“How can you say you love someone you can’t tell is dying?” The number of times I cried myself to sleep and he ignored it, pretended he couldn’t hear it“I know my pain is such an imposition” the time I asked what I could do to fix our marriage and he replied “stop being so sensitive” “Who only wanted you to see her” the times I begged for him to understand I just needed comfort and support when I was hurting “Do something babe say something” everytime I left or hung up or curled up in the corner and sobbed and he just let me go, let me hurt, and never did a damn thing“Unless you’re choosing me, you’re losing me” when I finally said either I’m enough, flaws and all, either you want to be with me, the emotional and loving and sensitive woman I am or it’s over. And he just said “if that’s what you want”This song. Yeah. This song.
Taylor, we need a music video for this masterpiece pleasee!! It's a necessity! Unless you're busy with rep tv of course
FINALLY!!! Thank you . Now the WHOLE Midnights album is finally on streaming and digital 
I have a bit of a different interpretation of this song as it relates to me- I see it as struggling with commitment issues as I do in most relationships. The “you’re losing me” happens pretty quickly for me, but I wish it didn’t so I want him to “do something, say something” to get those feelings of mine to go away because I truly want it to work out. I feel that “I bleed as I try to be the bravest soldier” when I try to keep these feelings inside and fight them so it could work with us. sometimes feel annoyed as he says he loves me but “can’t tell I’m dying.” I wonder if it’s worth it to deal with these hard thoughts or just let the whole thing go; “should I throw out everything we built or keep it?” In the beginning I may have “thought I cure (for this running away) would come in time, now it fear it won’t.” I know it was written for an entirely different end to a relationship but this song is so special to me because i can connect it to my own relationship struggles so specifically with these lines. thank you taylor 
本当にありがとうそしてトップアーティストおめでとう！！！日本に来るのを楽しみにしています、ずっと大好き.｡o(♡)
Ameiiiiiii, meu deus que musica mais linda desde mundo

I was so tired of looking everywhere to listen to song, thanks Tay for releasing it to streaming  such a good song
Thankyou taylor for finally giving us this masterpiece 
Gracias Taylor ️
Masterpiece ️
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS SONG MOM 
I love you Taylor!
One of her best songs 
This was really needed, thank you Taylor, especially after a recent break up I've been dealing with <3!
"You're Loosing Me" broke my heart and came 3 years too late. Pretty much the whole song makes me think of my best friend since 2002(who I was in love with for years, but she was straight). She married an abusive asshat who treated her and her kids like garbage. I couldn't save her. He ruined her life. She's now in prison (so is he), we write, but she came to her senses too late.  She was arrested in 2022, and her mom got the kids. My biggest regret is not trying to push her to leave him harder. But I was afraid of her choosing him and him making her cut me out. It was such a stressful, heartbreaking time because she wouldn't listen to reason from anyone. Our decades long friendship was falling apart because he was top priority. I loved her with every fiber of my soul still do, but our  friendship is too damaged. And with her being in prison for the next decade, I doubt we can fix it. We're not 12 years old anymore, after all.
Whenever I tell people I'm a fan of taylor, it's always a negative reactio . But in the end after everything she's been through it's made me stronger
Thank you. I had a horrible day and saw this notification. It made my day a bit brigter  Even though this song is sad, it's amazing. Was just the right mood.
My favorite song of the year finally on streaming
TAYLOR THIS IS FIRE!!! 
Thank you, Taylor! 
DIOS MIAAAAA AHORA YA ME PUEDO DESVIVIR CON LA VERSION ORIGINAL AAAHHHHHH
TEMAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 love this song so much! Taylor, you rule!
this song came at the perfect moment for me, made me decide i really want to leave this person. I'm still trying to put myself together before leaving. Hopefully in January i dont have to see them again
This song hits my heart so hard.
So glad its finally on streaming. But its so heartbreaking  im glad she seems happy now on tour and with travis 
Hasta los huesos... Taylor
Its a masterpiece!!
I can relate so much with this song that I cannot stop listening to it. Thank you, Taylor! 09/11, Bs As, Argentina. I was there and I remember it all too well
Finally! This song is truly a masterpiece.
amooo ya lo puedo escuchar legalmente 
Muy buena canción 
TE AMO TAY GRACIAS POR SACARLA POR FIN 
I can listen now anytime i want! 
I've been married for 9 years, together for 15. This song really speaks to me because my husband has mental health and addiction issues.
Incrível noite e uma música boa pra ouvir. 
Love it
Yeeeeeei    joya de canción.
Last April this year, when THE news came out- I was one of the swifties who took quite a time to have a denial stage on their breakup. I was acting like that in my part mainly because I just don't want Taylor to go through things again like what she went through before when breakups come in easily for her years/decade ago before Joe even happened to her- like I was scared of the media speculating about everything like her love life is a sport, they'll probably start to mock her for not keeping a man for good or she's gonna write a breakup album again, calling her a man hater or slvt/wh0re and stuff, it's just traumatic- some of you wouldn't get it cuz you weren't there (2011-2018 ESPECIALLY 2013-2016 like those years are nuts). BUT queen mother humbled me, Taylor made sure to let us know what really happened and she trusted us- my god the complete 180 of my beliefs after hearing 'You're Losing Me' in late May is funny but worth it at the same time. Then after hearing this song, I looked back on the past 4 albums we had from her with Joe beside her in that timeframe and wow, everything made sense like it showed me how gaslit I was and maybe her as well in that relationship that we witnessed all this time. I liked Joe cuz when almost everything went south in her career, she was at her lowest- he was there BUT that happenstance may also be the catalyst of how this relationship went down (in flames jk) aka the savior complex... okay idk what I'm saying here but somehow Taylor has this imagery of Joe as her 'knight in shining armor'- "he saved her from the darkness, great! happily ever after" but that wasn't the case here, with this mindset of Taylor plus Joe's demanding attitude or aura (cuz idk what really happened but it felt like the command is in Joe's favor in this) Taylor will tend to bend under his will (listen to willow, Joe really got her chase him and will do anything to get him) and adjust everything, her lifestyle and whatnot, in her power just to be with this man cuz this man doesn't want the life she's always been in, the scale of how magnified Taylor's life is as a celebrity/artist. In hindsight, we didn't know any of this and thought oooohhh Taylor is so in love and this is the endgame wow... but looking back now? it's just sad and aching to see Taylor looking like she's begging for him to stay, she did everything to make it work even staying with him where no one else can see them like they're hiding from everyone (ngl in the first 1-2 years of their relationship, Taylor needed that because of how her reputation shattered by the media and everyone in 2016-17 but eventually, she healed and go back to what her intended lifestyle and how she makes the whole place shimmer), she even avoided the idea of marriage (lavender haze) when 3 years in their relationship she's already dropping hints in his face my god (lover, paper rings, end game, i think he knows, willow, PEACE ugh i could go on) yet hE STILL WON'T COMMIT! idk what's his problem tbh, maybe he loved her when she was in her worst but honey, this is Taylor Swift- she will always rise from the ashes like a fckng phoenix and he broke that in her, she said she's tired even tho she's a phoenix- tired of sticking her neck out in this relationship with him doing nothing at all. The love they had was real at some point until Joe realized she's much bigger than this and she can be bigger than the last time he checked, he chickened out- he felt hesitant at some point in that 6 year relationship cuz he didn't want her way of living and it's inevitable that she will go back in the spotlight... she outgrew him. Taylor realized she's better than this and she finally knew her self worth to get away from this "stuck in the middle of nowhere, suffocating, and dying in the vine" relationship and you know what? good for her because I believe that in the name of LOVE, no one should be contained (feelings or validity of existence) it's love- not a possession... love is about GROWING, makes each other be seen and help each other to grow in their lives and NOT stuck in a box waiting to rot. I wanted to be kind to Joe but my god it almost felt like he wasted her time (6 years, 6 YEARS? and she thought they were gonna be end game), he led her on and left her hanging apparently. I'm just happy Taylor is in a very different place now, she's happy and that's all that matters to me. Thanks for coming in my TedTalk lol
Gracias Taylor swift por darle un soundtrack a mi depresión 
Is it just me or does the production sound different? Still beautiful. One of her best songs

Masterpiece 🫶
This was the song I listened to when i found out my ex- boyfriend and ex-bestfriend were talking behind my back and bitching about me. After i cut ties with my bestfriend about a month after it happened. I just didn't have the strength to break up with my bf cause those two were all I had in college. Then about a month after I heard this song and it exactly described everything i was feeling during that last month of our reltaionship. After so freaking long I finally felt like my feelings were validated when I heard this song. That I'm not overreacting and that people do feel this way. My bf never understood me at that time but Taylor did. And once i understood that my feelings matter, that i deserve to be understood and not manipulated into thinking that I'm overreacting, I finally found the courage to break up with him. Now, 6 months later I'm in such a great place mentally. I'm happy with myself. I'm understanding myself better and I always listen to my mind and body and validate whatever I'm feeling. Thankyou Taylor, you understood me when no one else did. And for that I'm forever grateful. Love, a fan always rooting for you!!!
Gracias Taylor te amo
