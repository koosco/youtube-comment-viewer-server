This music has helped me in my toughest times...love you ghibli studios <3
I find immense solace in listening to this music while I immerse myself in the world of drawing. It's as if the melodies and rhythms create a serene cocoon of tranquility around me, allowing my creativity to flow effortlessly. I can't thank you enough for providing this wonderfully relaxing soundtrack. It's like a gentle embrace for my soul. 
To everyone here listening to this awesome relaxing music, If you are feeling down today, remember this: Life its like a rollercoaster, full of ups and downs but in the end it will always be worth it. Don’t give up! We believe in you!
I listen to this while drawing and it calms me down. Thank you so much for this it’s so relaxing
Best thing to listen to when studying/taking notes/doing test/doing homework. It helps me focus so much, I listen to it while I draw, too! I'm so addicted to this music, I listen every day :)

Life is like a piano; the white keys represent happiness and the black show sadness. But as you go through life's journey, remember that the black keys also create music

Thank you for making this sound
4 years later…. As if destiny is really trying to make fun of me. I saw you on your hometown. I was at the car, while my sister is trying to park it. And then I saw you walking, how can I forget that walk, so towering, so full of presence. After 4 years, I finally saw again the man who made my days good and the same time worst without him knowing. Oh how much he really affected me after all this time. But no, I don’t feel remorse on him because I shouldn’t be, I have no right but I feel at ease somehow a little funny. You walked towards the café to have some snacks, I walk past you, not flinching, a little bothered somehow. I can’t say if you saw me, but I can feel you staring my back or perhaps it’s just my imagination. I could have approached you but I did not. I want what was made from that 4 years of separation from you be established. If you have saw me, you could have approached me too but you didn’t. So I guess it is what is. But really, I was happy to see you that day. It answered my questions, of longing, of trying to move on. It was an answered prayer. And I guess I am now so much ready to let you go. Or maybe I did let the feeling go way before I just didn’t realized it. And that day was an affirmation of my feelings for you. No it was not gone, not all of it. I just learned to accept, and by accepting I was able to move on, and on moving on, I am at peace.
I love this tune 
Thanks how it calms <3 what's the name of song 1:01:02
