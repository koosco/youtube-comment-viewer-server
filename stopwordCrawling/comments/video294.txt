Welcome to my channel  Have fun listening to music  And have a nice day 
My dad's friend owns a jazz bar, and the music is amazing. This sounds like exactly something the band would play- one time I even got to perform ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beginning to see the light‚Äù, ‚Äúfly me to the moon‚Äù and many others with a sax player, a trumpet player, a pianist, a drummer, and a bassist. It was probably one of the best experiences in my life. Jazz has a way of making you feel like you're on top of the world. Love the compilation and hope the 1% reading this has a great day
This is the only thing that helped me sleep during my pregnancy and now it‚Äôs the only thing that puts my babies to sleep. Thank you! Sending so much love and positivity your way6Lonely StarReply
Exquisite, and as sensational as ever. I don't just like this Bossa Nova, but simply LOVE and ADORE it. Perfect for uplifting anyone from a despairing mood to happiness and joy. Keep it up!!!
The music and visuals create a perfect backdrop for cozy moments during the changing seasons, inviting us to savor the unique charm of this time of year. 
I absolutely love this soothing music, especially at my hectic face paced job. I take a dose of this music frequently while at the office. I have started playing it at home, so peaceful. Have a beautiful day from Detroit, MI.
This is absolutely lovely, especially now that the weather is beginning to cool off. I listen to it every morning and light a few candles while I read my Bible and it creates such a perfect ambience. Thank you!
‚ÄúLife is a lot like jazz - it's best when you improvise.‚Äù - George Gershwin Jazz is one of the genres of music that I appreciate and I am often chill in the presence of it...Thank you for sharing this music.Take care, stay healthy happy and safe.

Welcome to my channel, jazz hop enthusiast!  This mix will be your perfect companion to make the workday breeze by, even on a slow holiday. Keep the positive vibes flowing, and enjoy your Labor Day! 
good music.
What makes this Parisian music? Unlike here in the USA, in Paris they don't have music playing everywhere. I've lived in Paris and never heard recorded music being played in cafe's, restaurants, stores, elevators, etc. Thank goodness.
top !
Only piano, bass, and drums. But so deep.

Sorry, but there is nothing from this music that suggests Parisian cafe. This is simply the other half of the title -- relaxing jazz piano and background music.
