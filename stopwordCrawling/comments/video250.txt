This genre of music is what I love. It brings back memories and makes me wanna go back to the past.
Listening to Disney music always makes me feel more comfortable and at ease, thank you very much 
ディズニーピアノの音楽は心を温かくし、魔法のようですね。
if you're on your computer: open a second tab with ocean waves/rain sounds/nature sounds. the combination makes this compilation even more magical and wonderful than it already is 
When the first song was played I remember myself when I was a kid. It's soo nostalgic to me. I feel relaxing, no worries and my stress due to modules, it's all gone! I feel new again.. Aaaahhh what a beautiful sounds..
While listening to this, tears just fell for no reason. I guess I just miss the olden days when life is not as complicated as it is now. It's amazing how music from our past comforts us in the present through the happy memories it brings back. Thank you for this music.
This makes me so relaxed when I am working and it starts to get busy at my job. I love it !
So cozy, peaceful and fun at same moment. Im glad to find this :)
Thank you so so much for your great playlists!
listening and singing them softly with my future baby is my biggest dream, Im a Disney fan since i was a kid now I'm 32 I still love them and waiting my dream to come true just like the fairytales I used to know 
이것은 디즈니 음악의 훌륭한 버전입니다. 정말 디즈니 분위기에 빠져들게 만드네요 <3
Thanks for this graceful version. So reposeful!
The music list sounds perfect, cozy and peaceful

うわー、これはとてもリラックスできて、宿題や書き物をするときにもまったく気が散りません。 大好きです！ 
많은 오래된 디즈니 영화의 시작 부분에 이러한 사운드가 있었기 때문에 우리는 이에 대해 향수를 느끼는 것 같습니다. :)

I can't believe how much I love this tape I have played it so many times and love it so much that I can play it back in my head on the bus or wherever when I need to play it without the internet!
Listening with my baby and singing to him softly! Thanks!!

THIS PIANO IS SUPERB  IT GIVES ME THE VIBES AND FOCUS MORE ON WHAT I AM DOING! THANK YOU!
Let's just agree that music in itself is healing. It's an explosive expression of humanity. It's something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we're from, everyone loves music.
Thanks for sharing. Very soothing
With my headphones on high your music sounds fantastic to my head & ears.
Here comes a waveMeant to wash me awayA tide that is taking me underSwallowing sandLeft with nothing to sayMy voice drowned out in the thunderBut I won't cryAnd I won't start to crumbleWhenever they tryTo shut me or cut me downI won't be silencedYou can't keep me quietWon't tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechless'Cause I'll breatheWhen they try to suffocate meDon't you underestimate me'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessWritten in stoneEvery rule, every wordCenturies-old and unbending"Stay in your place""Better seen and not heard"Well, now that story is ending'Cause II cannot start to crumbleSo come on and tryTry to shut me and cut me downI won't be silencedYou can't keep me quietWon't tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechlessLet the storm inI cannot be brokenNo, I won't live unspoken'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessTry to lock me in this cageI won't just lay me down and dieI will take these broken wingsAnd watch me burn across the skyHear the echo saying I...Won't be silencedThough you wanna see me tremble when you try itAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechless'Cause I'll breatheWhen they try to suffocate meDon't you underestimate me'Cause I know that I won't go speechlessAll I know is I won't go speechlessSpeechless
It is a wonderful version of Disney music,  It's like I'm lost in the fairy tale world of Disney. It's help me study a lot

10 stars for your music!!! ×10
When I heard this playlist, I feel I come back to my young days. I thought about my forgotten recollection. So feel good
You play so well did it take months or years to finish practicing? And when did you start playing?
Greet. I love this enchanting music.
My gosh Frozen.. i resisted not singing to all the songs but "Let It Go" is an exception !! i think that even the ones who have never watched the movie can sing the song!!
あなたの音楽には、私が世界の頂点にいるような気分にさせてくれる力があります。 その気持ちをありがとう
All Disney songs make me feel nostalgic...
May your heart be filled with optimism, your mind with positivity, and your soul with a deep love for life. Embrace every moment and cherish every memory. Wish everyone here listening to music happy and always happy in life 
This music gives me the vibes I'm really inspired by it thank you
This is really beautiful 
I love music from Disney I watched  this like 3 times but when I realized about the missing kid . Since children I went like * like I was a kid I loved Disney It was my hero but this changed it all around*
Such beautiful music and beautiful artwork. I'm so happy ended when it did, and there wasn't a poorly made sequel put out with terrible art and story to tarnish its memory for the fans.
Hii , the piano covering is amazing ! May I know where to get those piano sheets pls ?
Being with you is strangely peaceful - Being away from you feels strange but also quite peaceful.
i love this so much!!!

Listening to this while the sunset is slowly fading.
공부할때 너무 좋아요이 playlist 만들어서 감사합니다 ^^
Studio Ghibli는 그것을 얻습니다. 그들은 SoL을 그토록 훌륭하게 만드는 요소를 마스터했습니다. 배경, 기차, 음식, 도자기, 조리기구, 은제품과 같은 작은 세부 사항... 그들은 그냥 이해합니다.
ディズニーは世界の宝物🩷

不错哦
WOW....thank you
Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. Or they are alone, they miss someone, they are depressed, hurt, marked by the past, they have people that nobody knows, they have secrets that you would not believe. They want, they dream and they hope. And now, you're sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you won't feel alone anymore. Always remember, don't be depressed by the past, don't worry about the future and focus on today. If today is not so good, don't worry! Tomorrow is another opportunity. If you're reading this, please share it to share and make others feel better. Have a nice day!

힘내세요 다 이루어 질거에요 누구보다 더 응원해요
<3  <3  <3 
The way I just yeeted my pen and notes away to have a performance in front a pile of books when it played let it go
I don't know if anyone will read this, but ... if you did, remember that you are great 
어렸을 때는 크면 디즈니 공주처럼 늘 강하고 행복할 줄 알았는데 그건 그냥 꿈이었네요 좌절하는 날이 많아지고 행복이 오면 겁부터 나요 불행도 올테니까
우리 엄마아빠 행복하게 해주세요 힘들지 않게 해주세요.. 우리 가족 아무 탈 없이 행복하게 해주세요.. 여기 계신 분들도 다 지금보다 더 나은 삶이 될 수 있기를 바라요
Sleepy
