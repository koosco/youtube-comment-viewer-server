LOVED having you visit us! 
Jose Sa is actually so sweet I loved his enthusiasm and how he was trying to use Korean
First of all Jose doing the absolute most to make him feel at home is the SWEETEST thing I’ve ever seen, totally immersing himself in this culture that is so far from his, as a Mediterranean myself I completely see our famous warmth and hospitality in him and makes me feel so happy and proud! Second as a huge football fan since birth, I love this content. In Italy we don’t really have this kind of connection with our players and teams and it’s a pity, my partner is American and so I follow American sports and this kinda reminds me of the way the NBA teams do content. I mean it’s not the same but it’s so much more approachable and builds report and my marketing brain wishes we would do something similar with Italian teams too, I’d eat that content up in a SECOND!
일부러 그렇게 한 건지는 잘 모르겠지만 영국인, 포르투갈인, 황희찬, 남미(브라질) 출신, 아프리카 출신 으로 출연 선수들이 다양한 지역 출신들이었던 것도 너무 좋았습니다~ 너무 재밌었어요 다음편도 기대~
as a portuguese seeing all the nice comments about josé makes me feel so good<3 im so glad you all like him
황희찬 선수 웃을 때 사람 기분 좋아지는 미소를 가진 거 같아요 ㅣㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀엽
josé really seems like such a sweet person, loved his enthusiasm!
Maximilian being scared of vegetables is absolutely hilarious 
I might need to start following this team! They're all so likeable, and Hee-chan especially is such a sweetheart. He looks so happy to have a taste of home.
Jose Sa and Hee-chan’s relationship is like husband and wife  “sweetheart” in the next episode  he is very enthusiastic! Another favorite in this series!!!!
Hee Chan, the Korean Guy!  Thank you so much for this show.  우리 희찬이 찾아가주고 영상 찍어줘서 고마워요.  왕팬임.  축구는 상남자, 평소에는 수줍음 만땅인 희찬이 울버햄튼에서 정착 잘하고 특히 요즘 맹활약 보여줘서 너무너무 감사함.  한국 음식 용감하게 먹어준 울버햄튼 선수들 고맙!
“I’m expensive” New characters unlocked! One of my top 3 fave episodes is when you introduce Korean food to British athletes 
와 황희찬 선수 영국 처음 갔을 땐 영어에 대해 문외한이셨던 걸로 아는데엄청나게 많이 능숙해지셨네요 ㄷㄷㄷ
Max’s fear of healthy vegetables is so hilarious  and it’s ironic because athletes usually love them  and his brother Michael is just so adorable 
Jose Sa is such a character. I’m a big fan of this dude and the energy he brings ️
희찬이형 먹을때마다 찐행복 웃음 나오는거 너무좋다 진짴ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
아아 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국음식 한보따리 싸서 갖다주고싶네ㅜㅜㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 희찬선수 든든히 챙겨먹고 부상 없이 이번 시즌 승승장구 하시길
Jose is the cutest  we need more of him
Jose’s Korean expression, “Massissoe! (맛있어!)” sounds so cute, funny and PERFECT!!! 
Hee-chan like an excited child reacting is adorable lol
i saw the wolves chef prepare a dish for hee chan a few days ago, and it made super emotional that he was getting to eat korean food. to find this so soon has brought me right back to being emotional, so happy he got have this, thank you guys for making it happen
I always love these videos, seeing people excited to showcase their national foods but also others excited to try, that’s always such a joy
This is so cute! Please do this with the wsl too if you have the opportunity would love to see this culture be shared 
희찬선수랑 동료들 챙겨주셔서 감사해요영국남자 짱! 희찬선수 힘내세요! 화이팅!
Take José Sá to Korea right now!! He would absolutely love other types of Korean food - love this man's energy throughout the whole video! Go Wolves! :)
I thought there is nothing much to surprised me on this series, but hey, José Sá is ADORABLE!!! Invite  him every time and bring him to Korea! He deserves it!
Jose Sa is really a cool dude especially when he says "Mashiso!" and trying his best to deal with spicy foods. Then, how hilarious is it for me to see Max being scared of vegetables; and his younger brother is so cute ... I'm looking forward for the next video involving those selected Wolves players eating Korean BBQ. 
Ooh i love this, Jose Sa is such an awesome guy...Ps. I cant get over of Hee Chan's laugh 
Jose was soooo cute I loved this enthusiasm and how he loved to say 마시써 
I was literally just rewatching the hashtag football team series and I saw this!!! Nice to see a new team trying food and having new perspectives/critiques to korean food! 
Max's brother is adorable.  
문화교류가 별로 많지 않았으니 물론 우연이겠지만, 콩고~가봉 쪽에도 호떡이랑 식감이 똑같은 게 있다니 놀랐습니다. 그것도 한 번 먹어보고 싶네요~ 맛있을 듯!!
Yes!! Been a massive fan of this channel for a long time and am a lifelong wolves fan, as is my whole family for generations so this is such a trip for me! The crossover I didn’t know I needed 
Hwang Hee Chan was smiling the whole time. He must have loved the food so much
They chose fun players to do the video.  Their reactions are so varied and fun.
I loved seeing how happy Hwang Hee Chan was to have food from home. He was pure joy.
황희찬 선수 시즌 중에는 식단부터 엄청나게 자기관리 하신다고 들었는데 저렇게 행복하게 먹는거 정말 기분좋네요ㅎㅎ
Love these videos where you go to English clubs it’s great to see them try other cultures and appreciate them 
Jose Sa is so warm and welcoming towards Korean food and culture  and Hee Chan too (:
Its so good to see Hee Chan here!! Loved this bunch of mixed reactions 
I wasn't the one who ate those foods but watching them enjoy it makes me happy, I smiled ear to ear. GOD bless you all
Hwang is becoming a big time star now. You love to see it.
조세싸 성격 진짜 좋다. 외국인들 어묵같은거 먹기 힘들어하는 경우 많이 봤는데 끝까지 웃으면서 말해주네 ㅎㅎ 실력만큼이나 인성도 월드클라스네
I loved Hee Chan Hwang with Jose Sa, so fun!! jose sa seems so nice and you can tell they are close
Jose whispering "I want to say thank you" behind a tray lol so endearing
Lemina and Jose Sa are adventurous and willing to try new food. So refreshing to see.
I truly love to watch these episodes, seeing them try korean food for the first time and seeing their happy reactions is so adorable 
This was very cute. Loved seeing everyone's reactions
“I’m expensive” made me laugh soooo hard! No experience with these guys but they’re all so charming right off and Hee-Chan is a hoot 
It's kinda refreshing seeing the hesitation in trying the foods. Nonetheless they were all open-minded and willing to dig in. Kudos!
저기서 먹기 힘든 음식일텐데 황희찬선수 잘먹고 좋아하는 모습 보니 엄마 마음같이 뿌듯하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ다른 선수들고 좋은 경험이었길 바랍니당^^
We need more Korean players in the PL teams so we can see all the teams trying Korean Food.
The harmony and togetherness in this Wolves is unlike any other. And it’s really showing on the pitch too.
Hee Chan with Jose Sa really the sweetest️ The end when Hee Chan said “맛있어 우리 애기?“ hahaha love the reaction from all the wolves players
aww, the Korean guy looked so happy throughout this whole thing. I love seeing people try this for the first time.
Love hearing Grace's laugh  its so distinguishable 
조세 반응 넘 웃긴닼ㅋㅋㅋ잘 따라해서 한국인 같은 리액션이네욬ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Soooo awesome seeing people try other cultures food.I can’t wait until the KBBQ next week!!!Also crazy that you get to hang out and talk, over food, to some of the best players in the EPL!
The reaction for the barbecue can't wait to watch next episode
Oooh can't wait for this series... the reactions are funny. Looking fwd to the bbq!!!
First time seeing Jose Sa outside the games and what a likeable dude. Genuinely seems like a fun dude to be around.
호세씨 친절하고 좋은 사람같아요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국말 하려는거 보기 좋네요. 황희찬 화이팅
I can’t wait for next weeks episode. I love when you guys introduce it for the first time!!!! 
It says a lot about the food you serve in these that Hwang Heechan appreciated it so much. When a native enjoys your version of his food, you've done something special.
How adorable is Hwang Hee-Chan?  He looked so happy. 
Love this content! Can't wait for part two.
아니 조세 사 선수님 왜 이렇게 귀여우세요 ?!??? 말투도 다정하시고 한국말 하려고 희찬 선수님께 묻는 것도 너무 친절하심..
황희찬 선수 진짜 행복해 보인다 먹고있는데 입가에 미소가 안사라지네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
hwang hee chan is so cuteeeeeee!! so glad he's eating well!!!
늑대들이  어쩜  강아지 처럼 귀엽나요~  울브 홧팅  황희찬과 친한  조세사ㅋㅋ 맷 도허티도 반갑네요 ~^^  영상  감사요
영국남자 Korean Englishman, Tteokbokki is not made with sticky rice(찹쌀), but with regular rice(멥쌀). I love this channel and wanted to let you know.
You could do a whole series with Jose and Hee Chan!
Jose is SO FUN. I love him already
Another amazing Korean food intro. I love watching people fall in love with Korean food(culture)  Thank you so much
솔직한 반응 너무 좋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
프로선수들의 인간적인 모습을 보는건 항상 즐겁다
울버햄튼 선수들을 이렇게 영상에서 보니까 선수 한명 한명 되게 사람좋아보인다황희찬 선수가  팀에 잘녹아드는거같아 안심도되고 도허티 선수가 황희찬 동료가되어 다시보니 반갑기도하고팀분위기 생각보다 더좋은거 같네요 이번 시즌 부상없이 좋은성적 이루시길 바랍니다.
They are so fun. I can’t wait for more content with them!
One of the best things about Korean Englishman, aside from excellent introduction of the Korean culture, is the fact that they manage to find guests that are adorable and will surely become a hit with their viewers. Like, how do they do that everytime? 
I really loved those players are enjoying their best time, eating some  Korean street food. 
My worlds collide - The Korean Englishman channel and Premier League are two of my favorite things. I love seeing the players try Korean food.
Omg woolves!!!️‍다들 순등순등 왜케 귀여워ㅠㅠ 희찬님 응원해용!! 항상 경기보고있어요🫶🫶
This video made me so happy. My wolf pack and my favorite YouTuber creators. Amazing!
This episode was really fun. Can't wait for the next one!
올 시즌 씨찬이형 폼 장난 아닌데.. 맛있는 우리 음식 맘껏 드셔서 진짜 레전드 한번 찍을 것 같습니다!
와우!!! 황희찬 선수가 있는 팀이라니!!!!! 너무 재밌게 봤어요 한국 음식 그리울텐데 잠시나마 힐링이 됐겠네요
i love these kind of series 
Love watching people try my native food for the first time 
KEM + = (The player that was diligently trying to learn Korean, so funny!)
Cannot wait to see them enjoy korean bbq!!!! That ssamjang 
We've seen so many of these that I thought there wouldn't be much left to enjoy anymore, but beyond enjoying this, i LOVE how each of them were so respectful towards other cultures' food. Bravo!!
Found out his name through the comments, so i too must gush about him- Jose SaReally liked his energy  willingness to try everything and speaking lil bits of Korean.Very cuteHe must be a great teammate
팀 케미가 좋네. 다들 매력넘쳐ㅎㅎ. 특히, 쿠나 Cunha 부끄부끄 한 듯 귀엽넹ㅋ
This is the content I enjoy.  Cool to see Hwang Hee Chan. I’ve been watching Gentlemen’s League with the Eojjeoda Avengers. He was a great guest!
내용도 반응도 재밌지만..현지인들이 쓰는 영어를 접해서 좋고..그들이 쓰는 문장을 요즘 한국어로 절묘하게 해석한 자막에 신경써주는것도 대단하다고 매번 느낌..
조제 사 선수 왜케 귀여워옄ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 다른 선수분들 리액션도 재밌고, 황희찬 선수 한식 드디어 먹어서 좋네요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ부상 안 당해서 좋은 모습 보여주세요!!!!!!!
The way he whisper that he wanna say thanks...sooo cute
Dude you guys are actually killin it 
Love these series! Thank you can’t wait until next week 🥹
It would be a great idea if you could invite more PL clubs to your show to have a try Korean foods like this video, i wish i could see more videos like this
Yes! This is it. Love it when these football players try the Korean food. Love to see their reaction. Thank  you for the vidoe.
코리안가이~~황희찬  팀에서도 국가대표에서도  좋은 모습 기대합니다 황희찬화이팅!!!대한민국 🇰🇷 🇰🇷 🇰🇷 🇰🇷 🇰🇷
The best part of this video is the fact that they took the foods that Josh and the crew brought for them back to homes as dinners as well!
They all seem to be great dudes, Jose is hilarious
우리 의찬이 순둥이 웃음 진짜 웃기네..ㅋㅋ 평서 먹는게 단백질뿐이 없다고 할정도로 철저한데  부상당하지말고 잘뛰어줬음 좋겠다.
빨리 다음편 보고싶네요 ㅎㅎㅎ 반응이 엄청 재밌네요 ㅎㅎ
Hee-Chan looks so happy 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ주제사 귀엽당  담편 더 기대되넹
Imo the best part is how appreciative he is that he gets to have Korean food. It’s very apparent as he said that he’s gone very long without having Korean food while being there. He must be homesick but this is like a nice refreshment like you’re mom coming to you and cooking a home cooked meal after eating out all the time
Loved this video!! Wolves team are great :D
채소 먹은게 어머님이 아시면 자랑스러워 한다는게 겁나 웃기네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
They are all cute and funny 
Combining my two favourite things in the world; food and football 
I would love to watch more videos with them.. please keep them videos coming..
Jose Sa have to be more on this series he is so nice and I love how enjoyed he is
I was smiling the whole time watching this now my mouth dried up 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
josh and ollie are fr gonna have multiple football teams, putting in korean chefs to work with dieting one day i'ma call it now. you can't be introduced to the world of korean food and not crave it at least one a week.
i know that next episode is gonna be amazing already
This was really fun! amazing people!
황희찬 선수 울버햄튼 입단영상 본게 엊그제 같은데 어느새 팀의 주축이 되었다는게 진짜 자랑스럽습니다희찬이형 싸랑합니다
아 황희찬 너무 귀여워ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ웃으면서 어깨에 기대는 거 치인다 울버햄튼에서 한식 먹기 힘들다니 맛저가 되었길 바라는 마음🫶
Wolves?! Incredible! Heechan looks so happy here. His teammates seems like a great bunch! (Doherty was Sonny's teammate, too!)
I became a fan of Hee Chan after watching the Korean show I live alone so this was def a great video
Let them try spicy noodles i wanna see their reactions 
나혼자산다에서 보니 철저한 자기관리와식단으로ㅈ머나먼 영국에서 개인의 커리어와 국가를 위해한국인으로서 얼마나 한국음식이 더 그리웠겠습니까?맛있게 먹으며 동료팀들과의 모습도 보기좋네요,부상 조심하시고 항상 응원합니다~!
8:47 I love how he always want to speak Korean 
Love seeing the Korean players introduce their teammates to the food with Josh and Ollie.Though I do find it a bit bizarre you have top flight footballers who 'don't eat vegetables', I thought their diets were pretty rigid at that level...
Hee Chan and Jose Sa need a Korean Englishman food tour of Korea.
i really love koreanenglishman... they are my go-to ytube channel whenever i want to binge watch...i just rewatch everyting along with jolly... my fav series is the football players...great to see that they are having football players series again.
I just know what all of them were thinking when they hesitated to eat the fish cake on the stick 
Such an adorable squad Wolves! Cheers from a Chelsea fan!
황희찬 너무 잘 먹는다ㅠㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋ귀여웡
코리안 바베큐를 내어주기전에 간식 먼저 내어주신거 정말 잘하셨어요 ㅋㅋㅋ
I'm from Wolverhampton so this was a BIG surprise. I'm not bias saying this but this was absolutely funny to watch, was laughing out loud and smiling throughout the whole episode. Can't wait for the BBQ episode.
Não sabia que o Mateus era tão fofo
 조쉬가  오래전부터 항상 떡볶이의 떡을 찹쌀로 만든다고 설명하시는데 떡볶이의 떡은 밥 해먹는 일반적인 쌀로 만듭니다.  밀가루와 전분을 섞은 밀가루떡도 있지만요. 정확한 정보도 중요해서 말씀드립니다.
Love how respectful san jose is
Can they try samgyupsal too or fried chicken K-style with maekju? I think they will love that. Hahaha
우리가 원하던 영국남자 채널로 돌아온 느낌입니다.  요리사 시리즈나 대학생 시리즈는 스케일은 크고 좋은것도 많지만...사실 이런 평범하고 소소한 것을 소개하고 공유하는게 재밌었어요.맷 도허티 선수 다시봐서 좋고  황희찬 선수가 찐으로 행복해하는게 느껴져서 즐겁네요. 개인적 바램으로는  친구분들이나 기사님들 출연도 그립습니다.^^
These guys are hilarious, bring'em back for more!
황희찬 선수님 이렇게 웃음이 많았나요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 행복해보여서 제가 다 기분좋네요 .. 그나저나 오른쪽 선수분 너무 귀엽고 유쾌하고 .. 최고 🥹
스트릿푸드라서 호불호가 많이 갈릴거라 생각했는데 생각보다 좋아해주시네요. 아마 다음 고기메뉴에서는 전승할거라 예상됩니다 ㅋㅋㅋ
This is the video i really realy loves.. i used to watch the hastag club over and over again.. I love it when you visit the football club. Thankyou Josh and Olly and all the korean englishman crews
"my mom will be proud of me" (for trying cabbage)"That is my captain" 
As a proud Wolf of some 50 years and a fan of Korean food for about 20 years this is just about the perfect video series. I'm so happy right now.
Hee-Chan is so handsome and funny 
sooo Hee Chan just ate everything twice? He really enjoyed this interview! hahahaha
I love the banter 
They're all so cute 
We need a series to Korea
메뉴가 한국인이면 무조건 좋아하는 메뉴들이네요..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 황희찬 선수 진심 좋아하는 표정 보이네요..ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
황희찬 선수 오기 전부터 울버햄튼 공격적인 축구 너무 재밌게 봤었고 중간에 주춤하긴 했었지만 황희찬 선수와 함께 다시 올라오는 모습 보니 너무 보기 좋습니다.더욱 더 힘내서 탑4 이상 그리고 추후에 우승도 할 수 있게 되길 응원합니다
I liked the guy from Gabon comparing hotteok to an African cake, he seemed kind of nostalgic
Can you do this for regular people in the USA who’ve never tried Korean food? I think that would be entertaining. You tried southern food. Now have southerners try Korean food. Lol.
황소 타국서 한국 음식 먹고 즐거워하는 모습보니 기분이 좋네요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
아 다음편이 진짜 기대된다
예전에 한국인의 식판 보면서 희찬 선수 시즌 중 한식 먹고 싶어한다는 얘기 듣고 또 한 번 비슷한 기회가 있었으면 좋겠다 생각했는데, 이번에는 팀 메이트들과 함께 특히 한국 분식을 즐길 수 있어서 보기 좋아요 비록 올해 내한 경기가 너무나 아쉽게도 무산됐지만, 내년에는 꼭 다시 추진돼서 한국에서 희찬 선수와 함께 직접 또 맛있는 한식을 즐길 수 있기를 바라요🇰🇷 이번 시즌 희찬 선수 부상 없이 아시안컵도 EPL 리그에서도 지금처럼 좋은 모습과 기량 보여줬음 좋겠어요.ᐟ COYW
희찬선수 좋아하는모습이 넘 보기좋아요  5:57  따라하는겈ㅋㅋ넘웃김
When Koreans in International teams want to eat Korean food in said international team HQs, Josh and Ollie deliver HARD.
this must be a really fun "media day" for the players, eating delicious street food instead of guessing other's rating on a football game or answering question on who's better between Gerard, Lampard, and Scholes.
Those guys are all adorable!
황희찬 음식먹고 찐으로 행복해하는 거 보기좋다...
희찬 선수에게 진짜 위로가 많이 되었겠네요.선수들이 우애가 좋은 팀 같네요.영국남자 팀, 국가비 고마워요!
드디어 영국남자가 돌아왔구나! 그래 이게 그리웠어! 한국에대한 무지를 한국맛으로 도배해버리는 이 감각 너무 오래간만인거 같아!
희찬님의 이런 인터뷰를 아에 본적이 없어서 어떤 사람인지 가늠할수가 없었어요축구하는 모습만 보면 완전 상남자인데, 이런 모습도 있었네요 조금 신기하기도 하고,  원래도 응원 했지만 더 응원 하고 싶은 마음이 생기네요
Jose Sa is actually a vibe! Very likeable dude :D
역쉬 한국인 씨찬이 맛있게 먹는 거 보니 넘 조타. 훨훨 날아라 울 씨찬이... 팀 선수들도 호흥도가 조아서 보기 좋음
Oh these lucky guys… they better act like the love everything  then they will invited to all the food shows and get to eat some fabulous Korean foods!!!!!!!!
역시 실패없는 메인은 한국식 고기요리지 ㅎ 빨리 다음편 나왔으면 좋겠다 ㅎ
희찬이형 잘 먹으니까 너무죠음 ㅎ ㅎ이렇게 힐링받고 경기 멋있게 뛰어주셔요!! ㅋ ㅋ
Jose Sa is so cute  희찬선수 너무 행복해하네요 ㅎㅎㅎ 마니머거요
You guys need to come to my club Bayern Munich and bring some for the top lad Kim Min-Jae. He had his Korean rice cooker stolen last week so he could do with this! :)
아 이거 다음편은 안나오나요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ너무 재밌어요 킬먼 주장:채소 안먹는다 늑대는 고기만 먹는다 쿠냐: 우리 주장님이십니다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ조세사: 나 상남자 잖아! 떡볶이 먹고 워터 플리즈ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
i love that "i wanna say thank you" jsjsj so cute <3 iim waiting moreeeee.... all of they are very charming ....
Kind of shocking that an athlete at the highest level doesn’t eat vegetables. But absolutely love how honest they were about what they liked and didn’t. And good on them for trying everything! Follow Wolves and watch some of their matches here in the States - will be keeping a closer eye on these mates going forward.Has me wondering if other channels or companies do similar things for different nationalities. Would love to see some food from Gabon or Portugal for Sá - he was a great sport!
I'm amazed that a professional athlete on a Prem Club with a whole nutrition department can have a player that just won't eat vegetables.
김말이를 행복하게 먹는 희챤선수 기엽다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 나도 조아 김말이 ~.~
its so fun to watch. a great content!
Next time you guys should try some Haïtían foods! 🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹다음에는 아이티 음식을 먹어보세요! 🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹da-eum-eneun aiti eumsig-eul meog-eoboseyo! 🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹
It's my favourite kind of series.. footballer reaction is always funny. Thanks 
분식도 싫어하는거 같진 않은데 코리안바비큐에는 진짜 찐 리액션이 보이네요 ㅋㅋ 다음편 기대됩니다 ㅋㅋㅋ
솔직한 감상이 너무 좋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ솔직히 한국음식 맥이고 무조건 맛있다고 해달라고 하는 듯한 영상 ㅈㄴ 많은데 ㅋㅋ그냥 소개만 하고 솔직한 평가 해주는 게 좋네 ㅋㅋㅋ
You guys should go to Bayren and share Korean food with Min Jae and the players
Wow this is such a treat for the guys for sure!!!
It would be interesting if teams that have international players would do a special event where they have concessions from that players home country.
나도 모르게 미소 짓고 있었음 
컨텐츠를 만드는 감각, 구성, 트렌드와 타이밍을 맞추는 능력이 타의 추종을 불허하는거 같네요.. 영국남자가 여기까지 올수있었던 이유도 장수하는 이유도 그것인거 같아요. +한국 문화에대한 진심어린 존중이 바탕이 되니 진정성이 늘 느껴져거 좋구요
Absolutely love these types of shows, but i have to say, i do hope you are making sure none of the people trying have any allergies. ;)
I love seeing ppl try food for the first time. Esp the football players 
주제 사 반응 진짜귀엽닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
You should try showing NHL hockey players Korean food! PS: if you do please do the San Jose Sharks in the Bay Area!
Jose sa nodding his head while they speak korean is crazy
I find it so funny that so many of them are terrified and picky eaters. In every video I've seen on this channel people come around so much faster than these guys did but they were all so scared. WHO HURT YOU?! 
WOLVES!! Hwang playing well this season
The onion guy with  the tatoos is so cute and funny 
분위기도 좋고 씨찬이형 잘지내는거 보니 흐뭇하네
아 황희찬선수 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ맛있는거 먹는거 보니까 제가 다 흐믓..
This is a challenging menu for total beginners, but they were good sports 
Hwang and his teammates are just absolutely charming haha
항상 좋은 컨텐츠 만들어주셔서 감사해요
