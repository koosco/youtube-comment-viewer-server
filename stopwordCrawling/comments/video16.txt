Wow the song is really good to hear!
As a Designer I am sweating at how much work 1 mv is from mave... All the modelling, animations, textures,... Such good work!
let’s acknowledge that if they weren’t a group with faceclaims that these girls would be so insanely popular! they sing and rap so damn good!
Terserah mau dibilang Mereka CGI atau Ai yang jelas Mereka tetap akan ada di dunia K-Pop  sepanjang masa dan pastinya Mereka 4 Makhluk Cantik abadi yang tercipta dari planet lain  untuk Maze
Who else appriciated the talent behind the animation? The singers, the animators, all!
Песня просто пушкаклип прекрасен, танец просто хочется самой танцевать, я уже раз 10 ть пересмотрела, голоса девушек невообразимы прекрасны, костюмы в тему, очень красиво
JUST IMAGINE WHAT THE GIRLS MUST BE BEHIND THE RAPPERS, DANCERS, VOCALS. IT'S AN IMMENSE PROUD TO BE PART OF THE FANDOM
At least you can know wether or not they put effort into the comeback everytime.
I've never thought I'd become a fan of a drawn girl group, but this one isn't a joke!The girls' vocals are super pleasant, that's what I'll always appreciate The MV is dynamic and fascinating! I love it, to the whole team who worked on this - great job! Hope the group will go on for long and show us a lot of fresh and interesting things!
Sometimes I feel like the real people behind them probably just want to not reveal themselves to the world but want to share their love of singing with others. This would be a great opportunity for them to live their dreams while hiding their identities   Congratulations on your first comeback ladies 
Their vocals are TOP TIER!! I was afraid they wouldn't be able to top Pandora but I'm so glad I was proven wrong! STAN MAVE:!
Amei
omg mave!!! good job to everyone involved in this comeback, it's perfect
Idc what others says. But I loveeeeeee this group. Fighting girls
As a 3D modeler and 3D animator this amazes me and inspires me alot plus the song is just too good
I like this music video even more than Pandora. Urban style is one of my favorite. So many details in this animation. I can rewatch this video multiple times and always notice something new
Chorus part so amazing
Lagunya bikin candu.. Suara mereka keren banget
진짜 열심히 만든 게 보인다...퀄 대박
I’m so happy they finally came back 
It's so good. Please keep making song releases. This is the first girl group that I really appreciate like this. Thanks a lot animators. You guys are the best. Fighting MAVE!
THESE EFFECTS ARE KILLING ME WTF THEYRE SO GOOD 
カッコよくてこんなに自然な映像作ってくださった方達、作曲者も振付師もダンサーもボーカルの方達も皆尊敬します！！！レコーディングの様子も見てみたいです！
Suara mereka bagus banget please . Suka lagu-lagu mereka.
It never ceases to amaze me how amazingly realistic and flawless their movements and looks are
How does an anime character have a better song than babymonster?????Say whatever you want to, but one thing y'all aint gonna lie about is how good their songs are. Great good song with repeat value. The MV spot on. Everything beautifully done ️
Прекрасные 
와 점점 자연스러워지는 게 신기하다 판도라 노래 즐겨 들었는데 이번 노래도 넘 좋음 
I really like their music
eu amo MAVE: e acho incrivel o trabalho dos desenvolvedores e designers desse grupo, além das vozes perfeitamente impecaveis e modelos de corpo pra tornar todo esse grupo real. o unico fato que fico pensando é se esse será o futuro do kpop. pense: elas serão lindas, jovens e perfeitas para sempre. jamais envelhecerão, jamais ficarão doentes, nada. se alguém da equipe ficar assim será substituido por alguém com voz ou corpo parecido ou com o trabalho parecido e é isso. é esse futuro que queremos?
Their songs are honestly better than other groups these days
PERFEITASS!!! Valeu a pena esperar o comeback 
These INSTRUMENTALS?????!!?!?Congratulations on the 1st Comeback!
the music production is SO GOOD, 10/10
Mave Your Vocals, Rap, Dance And Avatar Is So Top Level. 
OKAY HOW DID THEY JUST TOP PANDORA?!?!!?!!!! Like their debut was so fcking iconic but this IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!! Their vocals have me DEAD ESPECIALLY SIU, Tyra and Marty absolutely slayed that rap, and omfg the mv is so cool I love that they kept in so many nods from Pandora and some virtual aspects in general!MAVE LITERALLY CAME TO SLAY AND ON THEIR FIRSTFCKINGCOMEBACK!!!!! They are well on their way to being my ults!
Woww not expecting mave comeback will be this good, Pandora era was great 
This was a good comeback. Mave's vocals are impressive and the cgi is looking better.
Я в восторге от клипа! Думаю, такими и должны быть музыкальные видео подобных уникальных групп - воплощать то, что не сделают обычные группы!!️
The people behind these groups are amazing
와 이번노래도 좋다 캐릭더도 더 자연스러워짐 진짜 발전개쩐다 개발자들멋져요
노래 진짜 개좋아... 1집은 좋다 쳐도 2집까지 좋은 경우는 드문데 진짜 곡 잘 뽑는다.. 내가 ai를 좋아할 줄이야
기술력 진짜 대박이다... 노래도 좋고
Grup AI paling niat, Lagu nya enak semua, Fresh!, MV bagus banget kerasa Futuristik nya, SUARANYA BAGUS SEMUA, sumpah ini grup keren asli
Woww
Absolute bopper!!! Get ready for the dance covers and challenges
Mave는 가상의 그룹이지만 활력이 넘칩니다.
Their vocals and rap are insane !! I also like the choreography dance, especially the point of the movement forming a square as if it were their symbol LET'S GO MAVE: !! I LIKE THE CHANGE OF THEIR OUTFIT 
0:36 And 1:50 Such A Catchy Melody , I Can't ! I'm Just Addicted To That Part On My Birthday ️️️
SPECTACULAR 
Ficou animação lindíssimas.
the cgi for this is just way too good! Smooth, stylistic, yet realistic enough to trick me into thinking that they are actual people ;-;.
ESSE GRUPO É SLAYYY
언니들 개 이쁘고 퀄도 더 좋아짐 ㅠㅠ 매이브 흥해라... 라방도 하구 콘서트로 열어주세여...
THEY SLAYED SO HARD! The Visuals~! 
Maravilhosas... Ansioso para ver isso nos music shows!
Gosh they are so talented. Kudos to the teams that work together to create the graphics and everything else!
메이브 컴백 추카해요  노래 너무 좋다

M.A.V.E surpasses itself in every comeback
Mave comeback with another amazing songs. Congrats MAVE

Stan the talented humans behind them  maze forever 
i'm in love with this comeback!! their movements omggg .. very realistic! AND VOCALS?? WOW
O comeback está perfeito, elas só melhoram 
the animations and textures are so well made, it's truly a joy to watch their MV's.
MAVE no se cansa de sacar temazos 
CARALH000 ESSE FINAL FOI GENIAAAAAAAAAAL
I need MAVE to be ambassadors for inZOI when it drops.
their vocalists behind are AMAZING
감사합니다. 좋은 노래, 좋은 목소리. 좋은 mv입니다. (⁠•⁠ө⁠•⁠)⁠♡♪
The amount of effort it was put in into by many talents is crazy.I LOVE MAVE
I was wondering when a new MAVE MV was coming out glad to see they are still going strong 
노래 너무 좋아요! 뮤비도 좋고 확실히 점점 발전하는 게 보여요메이브 화이팅!!
THE WYA THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IVE HEARD A COMEBACK AND LOVED IT SO MUCH ON THE FIRST LISTEN IDK HOW THEY DID IT BUT THIS SONG IS ACTUALLY SO AMAZING
4K 뮤비 미쳤다 진짜 퀄리티 더 좋아짐 ㄷㄷㄷ
A MUSICA TA INCRÍVEL
música muito boa, ameiii. ️
'WHAT'S MY NAME' É UM HINO, AMEI DEMAIS, OS VOCAIS, O RAP, A DANÇA E O MV ESTÃO IMPECÁVEIS, OBRIGADO POR ESSA PERFEIÇÃO, AMO MAVE: ♡♡♡♡
MAZE, let's work hard supporting MAVE. We should stream their album on music platforms and What's My Name M/V
tremendo MV, muy buen comeback de mis bellas virtualitas.. Excelente trabajo hay detrás de esta produ :)
MAVE: IT'S A BEST GROUP WITH WONDERFUL VOCAL AND GOOD DANCE, LET'S SUPPORT ALL GIRLS GUYSS!!!
LO AMÉ, ES ESPECTACULAR
Amo o grupo mave!!! Espero que lancem mais musicas , são todas perfeitas e os mvs também são perfeitos
Bro the vocals,rap n the dance it's just FIREEE....The girls who worked on it behind the scenes SLAYEDDD...I'm sooo happy to be in this fandom
I'm telling you the truth, if it weren't for AI, it would have extraordinary popularity. I've loved it since they released Pandora 
Bro this is dope! I loved it 
메이브 저번 노래도 좋더니 이번 노래도 좋네 
AWESOME!!!MUITO BOM!!! EU AMO MAVE!
This deserves so much attention...vocals are top notch!!! Tbh these days kpop has kinda lost focus on vocals like these.....so hearing this feels amazing
Amazing
Imagine a collab between MAVE , PLAVE and SUPERKIND, that’d be pretty sick
Mave vocals are more stable than my finance and my mental health
곡 퀄리티 무엇.. 앨범 전체적으로 다 좋던데 기다린 보람이 있다!!!
I love MAVE: for always having this "K/DA" like sound and they delivered again this comeback! SO good 
The vocals are insane, they are saaaangirs, those runs riffs ufffff 100 / 1
Надеюсь дальше больше. Очень не хочется что бы эта виртуальная группа пропала так же как кда
I really like it because this Idol is really different from the others 
This song is really good and the CGI is amazing. I like the concept of a virtual group, as long as it uses real singers, real dancers, etc. and not AI. There are too many talented people out there for us to be using a damn computer for everything. I would not be happy if this group competed in music shows though, since I don't consider them idols. Idols are the very select few that can do everything; singing, rapping, dancing, and have the visuals. I'm thinking that they have different people for the singing and then the dancing. (unless the singers are also the dancers, which would be cool)
Puts grila, as músicas delas são sempre tão bem produzidas, fico de cara toda vez
맙소사, 정말 완벽한 MV와 중독성 있는 노래네요, 축하합니다 MAVE, 당신은 완벽해요!!!
I am obsessed with this song I never thought I'd like it this much tbh
Tyra movements are so realistic. The facial expressions and  everything. The did a rlly great job and i like the song. Congrat
wow they are so good always
Love itttttttThis is so refreshing, I always wait for your another comeback
미쳣어 진짜ㅠㅠ 노래 개좋잖아ㅠㅠ
Amei tudo
I think Mave is my ult anticipation for pure AI/avatar group or whatever it's called (i mean group with only virtual members), their songs always catchy, it's kpop coded with good choreo, rap flow, vocal tone and techniques, their detail visual appearance, like her hair moves, her mouth sync, their angle, bruh it's so clear and great, good job mave and team!
Excelentes voces y canción, ojalá fueran más conocidas! Hay un gran trabajo detrás de todo lo que hacen.
So many good songs coming out right now .
A Comeback from this group was already needed, which without a doubt is Only
they keep on delivering bops  such a beautiful and strong voices and rap, and those harmonies are straight up heavenly~
Đoạn rap cuốn vãi luôn á 
Está canción me encanta, no me la puedo quitar de la cabeza, me encanta!!!!! Valió la pena la espera, algún día espero conocer a las que cantan, son hermosas!!!! El mv es genial, fabuloso  Stan Mave!
Amazing song and video
메이브 컴백 축하해요~~!많이 기다렸어!

MAVE siempre saca buenas canciones, me gustó la animación, buen trabajo 
mave never disappoints us
This is a great song, I was expecting nothing less after Pandora. Great job girls and production crew.
This is what we call quality over quantity
The most deliberate group, the song is excellent overall, Fresh!, the music video is fantastic, futuristic, the vocals are GOOD ALL, and the Oath is the original hip-hop group.
I'm amazed, how strong are the vocals!!!
THEY SLAYED
MAVE are so talented!
Pelo amor de Deus, debutem as meninas donas dessas vozes!  
Their vocals in this song are better than their last song. I'm impressed..
Боже они шикарые Siu i love you

THIS WAS SO GOOOD!! Welcome back MAVE!!!!!! 
TOPPED THEIR DEBUT OMG I LOVE THIS SM, THEY’LL NEVER DISSAPPOINT I KNOWWW
OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!! I was Waiting for there Comeback and its Finally Happened 
It’s kinda cool honestly. I don’t know if the girls who sing are also the dancers, but they all get to live out dreams of being an idol while being anonymous. Sounds better than being in the spotlight all the time.
Great song and and mini album just love it  completely fallen in love with the song Everyday   thank you keep making great music love from the UK 
The song is incredible
I keep wondering the people behind these beautiful voices, slayyyy
Q perfeito, mave nunca erra uma

OMG SO GOODI LOVE IT
Wow absolutly fantastic, hope they have the oportunity to promote in music shows 10/10★
i dont know why i think like MAVE: always killin' it? from PANDORA to this ,  i think they did a very good job , amazing , fabulous works , even they didnt show their real faces and personality only lik that , but behind i swear we will see the best i think they need to be famous , more than now , i wanna see them enter the stage like any kpop band like IVE , AESPA , BLACKPINK ..... anyway i am proud of them like .
Quiénes serán las voces detrás?Cantan muy bien ️
Elas voltaram com tudo
MAVE never disappoints.
