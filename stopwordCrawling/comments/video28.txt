so happy for him, its like any young adult meeting someone who admires
เป็น EP ที่ทุกคนจะได้เห็น และรู้จักเมนของเราดีขึ้นว่าเค้าเป็นคนที่ละเอียดอ่อน อ่อนโยน และใสซื่ออย่างเป็นธรรมชาติ เมนเราเค้าคือนิยามของคำว่าไม่มีพิษมีภัย อยากให้คนที่ยังไม่รู้จักเค้าลองเปิดใจเข้ามาศึกษานิสัยที่แท้จริงของเค้าก่อน แล้วคุณจะรู้จักว่ามันมีจิงๆนะคนที่เป็น Safe Zone ให้เราได้ ใครได้เป็นคนรอบข้างคือต้องเป็นคนที่กู้ชาติมาไม่รู้กี่รอบ เพราะเค้าใส่ใจคนรอบข้าง และอ่อนโยนต่อคนรอบข้างมากๆ ขอบคุณแบมที่เกิดมาให้เรารักนะ ทำให้เรารู้ว่าโลกน่าอยู่มากๆ เมื่อมีแบมแบม 🥹🫰
둘다 온순하고 착하고 본인일에 대한 열정이 크고 좋은 사람인거 같아 보는 내내 광대가 올라가고 눈웃음이 절로 지어지내 흐믓해서 ㅋㅋㅋ 태연이도 이번 앨범 대박나장~~! 뱀뱀이도 앞으로 좋은 앨범 많이많이 내줬으면 좋겠어!!! 
Love the interactions between them. Taeyeon is so warm and gracious interacting with Bambam knowing he's a big fan, but Bambam is still so charming and sweet even when being nervous. They look relatable and can be good friends.
태연과 뱀뱀 서로 응원하는 사람 손 든다  항상 행복합니다
Bambam always has this natural kindness and child like aura, he is one of a few idols that are so likable & relatable and this episode just proves that! I hope he knows that a lot of people loves him for being himself 
성덕 뱀뱀 같은 소원으로써 너무 부럽고 축하해요~~~~~
Taeyeon's song is rly your go to if you want healing or just want to relax your thoughts. Bambam, is such a genuine fan everyone can relate. This is such a warm content. I'm just smiling all the time.
This is what platonic love is. Bambam's heart is so pure. Thank you for loving Taeyeon so much
태연이 초대해 주셔서 감사합니다 뱀집 태연 뱀뱀 화이팅 
서로 부끄부끄하는거 넘 훈훈하고 귀여워서 댓글 안달수가없음,,, 탱구 뱀이 긴장 풀어주려고 노력하는것도 넘 서윗하고 뱀뱀 뚝딱이는것도 넘 귀엽고 이 영상 킬포가 몇개야
나는 꽤 오랫동안 이 순간을 기다려왔다. 나는 울음을 멈출 수 없다. 뱀뱀이 정말 자랑스러워요. 그의 본색은 아이돌은커녕 요즘 사람들에게서도 찾아보기 힘든 모습이다. 꿈을 이루는 뱀뱀은 나를 팬으로 표현한다. 모르시는 분들을 위해 말씀드리자면, 뱀뱀은 트위터와 틱톡에서 악의적인 사람들의 공격을 받았는데, 이 상황은 걷잡을 수 없을 만큼 커지고 그의 정신 건강에 막대한 영향을 미치고 있습니다. 그가 받는 혐오 댓글의 양은 너무나 불공평하다. 그의 죽음을 바라는 사람들, 그의 국적을 비웃고, 그에 대한 잘못된 정보를 만들어 퍼뜨리는 사람들이 있다. 너무 늦기 전에 이 사람을 보호해야 해요. 뱀뱀은 정말 맑은 사람이고 그의 성격이 사람들을 좋아하게 만드는 것 같아요. 뱀뱀이 자신의 진정한 본질을 바꾸지 않기를 진심으로 바랍니다. 그것이 그를 특별하게 만드는 것이기 때문입니다. 뱀뱀 사랑해요. 우리는 당신이 믿을 수 없을 만큼 자랑스럽습니다.
The love bambam has for taeyeon is so real to the point that he makes this episode in 2 parts!!! And its almost 40 minutes!!!
내 첫 그룹이었던 소녀시대 당시 태연 누나가 19살때였는데 벌써 같이 30대가 됐다는게 믿기지 않는데 노래도 잘 부르고 미모도 갈수록 더 예뻐지고 지금도 항상 응원하고 있고 뱀뱀 저 마음 소원이었던 사람으로서 누구보다도 더 잘 알고있는데 성덕 뱀뱀 영원히 잊지 못 할 날로 기억하겠다
팬심이라는데도 설레서 몇번을 보는지 모르겠네+자막도 제작진분들도 뱀뱀따라 팬이 되신건지 최종목표인 태연님이 나오셔서 진심 정성 가득하고 센스넘쳐요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
어떤이의 팬이라면 뱀뱀이의 맘이 어떤지 너무 알것같아서 보는데 같이 떨리구 행복해요^^
뱀뱀님 성덕되어 너무 부럽고 한국어는 한국인 보다 더 잘하셔서 놀랐고;;; 우리 태연언냐는 영원히 활동해 주세요
the way he made sure it's exactly 39 min (TY's bd is 03.09) his love and admiration for her is just too pure TvT
Bambam's reaction is the perfect representation of all fans. Love love love the natural reaction!
뱀님! 저희들처럼 같은 방법 팬심으로 다가가는 모습이 공감되고 너무 기분좋은 만남이었어요 대리공감도 되고 스타신데 같은 팬심으로 좋은 영향력 주셔서 감사해요! 덕분에 저희 팬들도 행복했습니다! 소원일때 아이돌이 아니다라는 그 말에 정말 같은 마음으로 멋졌어요 저두 언니 덕분에 뱀님 항상 응원할께요!
뱀 진짜 예의바르고 스윗하고 담백하다 너무 좋다
태연은 진짜 남돌들의 여신인가봄 뱀뱀이 이렇게 수줍어하고 어쩔줄 몰라하는 건 첨보네 소녀시대가 2PM이랑 콜라보가 많았었고 그때 뱀뱀은 연습생이었을 때니 진심 태연은 동경의 대상이었을듯 떨리는 목소리로  "나의 최종 목표"라는 말을 반복하는 게 이해가됨
탱구 초대해주셔서 너무 고마워요To. X  많이 사랑해주세요🫶
진짜 뱀집이 에스엠보다 홍보 더 잘한다…🥹 탱구 불러주셔서 넘 감사합니다!! 뱀뱀님 반응이 소원 그 자체라 제가 앉아있는 기분이예옄ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 담편도 빨리 주신다니..진짜 뱀집 짱
뱀이 너무 귀엽다 태연도 뭔가 어색하고 수줍어 할 줄 알았는데 오히려 동생 편하게 해주려고 말 많이 하려는 게 너무 배려심 깊어 보임….
I am so happy for you BamBam! You are living out every fan's dream! Thank you for working so hard, debuting and finally getting Taeyeon's attention. Bonus for getting her to come to your house! Please take time to celebrate and we will be waiting to see more!
This was a great episode! It was really funny how nervous Bambam was, he really channeled the full SONE energy xD Being one myself for the longest time and with Taengoo as my bias, I can really appreciate how much admiration, respect and love he has towards her. Go Bam!
nonono lo linda que es taeyeon, amo que los dos siempre buscaban la comodidad del otro. Bambam bien lindo regalandole cosas hasta para su perrito

뱀뱀 너무 따뜻하다주변에 저런사람있으면 정말 다가진것 같을듯
Can really understand Bam's feeling. Taeyeon's voice really helped me getting out of bad days, that's why Taeyeon is so special to me . Thanks Bam for making it happen and wish there is another Taeyeon episode next season!
탱구 오늘도 너무 이쁘다.. 순수한 사랑을 보니 너무 힐링되네요
어머…. 뱀뱀님이 제가 좋아하는 아이돌들이랑 접점이 좀 있어서 가끔 봤었는데태연님 앞에서 모습은 정말 찐으로 소원이시네요 ㅎㅎㅎ너무 정성스럽게 최애를 대접하는 모습이 귀엽기도 하고 멋지기도 하고 매우 보기 좋았어요🩷
Me emocione tanto como Bambam, como ahgase y fan de Taeyeon se siente como si yo la hubiera conocido , su música es realmente preciosa, transmite demasiadooo
He really shared how her songs has affected him (If and 11:11), even how he felt watching her variety show (WGM), and even what he kind of copied or got inspired of from her MVs (makeup). He is such a fanboy, and now a succesful one!! Congrats Bammie, from a fellow SNE here 
우리 배미 성덕 모먼트 보기 좋다 나도 떨렸었고 캬 우리 배미 어떡해 덜덜덜 하겠다 이런 반응이 입 밖으로 나옴 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 커여워라ㅎㅎ 세상에서 제일 예쁘고 귀엽고 깜찍하고 천사 보컬 원탑 태연 언니 그리고 우리 배미 가수 오래 오래 했으면 좋겠고 건강하고 행복만 하세요~
What Bambam said was really relatable, Taeyeon's voice and music really really heals. Even if we don't know Taeyeon personally, her music and voice still makes us feel better on bad days and even good days. Her voice is so precious like her personality, we don't even need to know Korean to feel her emotions. Taeyeon never makes bad music for me, but "To.X" is such a phenomenal album, it really fits the winter season right now and it's been on repeat for me!
Si ven esto y ya está la parte dos, denle like por favor jajaja que no soy fan de el como Idol o del grupo, pero me gusta su programa, se ve que es muy lindo y honesto con sus sentimientos, me gusta ver este tipo de interacciones.
뱀집 2편 화요일 7시에 풀어주다니 센스 넘치시네요ㅋㅋ 탱구 To.X 많이 들어주세요 
태연은 말도 너무 조곤조곤 예쁘게 하는데 유머랑 센스는 있고 ㅠㅠ 표정도 다양해서 귀여워
팬심이라는 순수한 사랑이 진심으로 느껴져서 보고만 있어도 내가 다 행복해지고 순수해지는 느낌이네요 너무 좋다🥹🥹🥹
뱀뱀 축하해여
Im feeling so emotional. This is definitely the definition of being a true fan. Non-toxic and just pure admiration and inspiration. Having an idol like how Bambam sees Taeyon is definitely so relatable to me. I hate it so much when people think that I want to date my idols. They're my idols because they inspire me to continue living and I find solace in their music or work. I want them to have their own private lives and have a beautiful family (if they choose to) and life in the future.
누군가를 저렇게 선망하고 그걸 또 이룬다는게 좀 부럽다ㅎㅎ
덕계못 룰을 와장창 깨부심….. 탱구웅니 넘 예뿌당ㅜㅡㅜㅠㅜㅠ 아니 수명이 짧아진다는게 진짜 찐팬들이 하는 말들이라서 넘 웃김ㅠㅜㅡㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
que hermosa esta sensacion de ver a tu persona favorita interactuar con su persona favorita. Me dieron hasta ganas de llorar al ver que bamie pudo decirle lo mucho que lo ayudo y lo feliz que lo hace
39분이 이렇게 순식간에 지나간다구요?? 찐 성덕 모먼트 잘 보여서 제가 다 설레였어요 이 조합 너무 흐뭇하다
뱀뱀이 드디어 태연씨를 만났습니다 
I want to say a few words as a sone since 2010 and ahgase since 2014. Bambam faces many malicious comments nowadays and many people interpret his love and adoration for taeyeon as creepy. Bambam is a good and kind artist who left his country since 13 years old and to debut and be famous as east asian in korea isn't easy at all so meeting his idol and one of the reasons he pushed and worked hard to debut isn't creepy but innocent. I hope people stop and think twice before attacking bambam. He always worked hard to be a great artist who represents thailand and for his fans to be proud of. Taeyeon isn't the type of artist who would feel annoyed by that. She has been in this industry for so long so if she ever felt uncomfortable, she wouldn't have come to this program. Please support both artists 
우리 탱구언니 너무 귀엽고 예쁘고 뱀뱀이도 귀엽ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ찐팬텐션 넘나 공감쓰좋은 사람들 항상 응원하고 오래오래 가수 해주세요
I’m so happy for Bambam and Taeyeon is such a sweetheart. I love these two they’re both talented people and both deserve to be loved by everyone. This is the first time I saw Bambam get his face red and panicking. he's such a relatable person.I want to hear bambam rap again..MAYBE COLLABORATION WITH THESE TWO?
태연 말하는게 다른방송보다 편해보이고 메이크업도 자연스러운게 이쁘네
O bambam quase infartando perto da Taeyeong ksksksks q fofo Alem de fanboy ele é muito profissional, esse foi um dos meus episódios favoritos 뱀뱀 진짜 잘했어요 <33
he's so me! I felt that I would react the same way if I had the chance to be with her. and yes, taeyeon, you healed my heart, and your voice has been a huge comfort for me when I'm not feeling good. you have no idea how many hearts you have healed just by singing and being yourself!thanks for being so sweet to her, bambam!
It was so cute. He did a great job expressing himself, his fan boy heart  while being a profesionnal mc. Congrats Bambam.
뱀뱀님.. 최애를 앞에 두고 뱀뱀님은 정말 잘하신 거예요........ 대단하십니다 ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 첨엔 성덕 되신 거 부러웠는데 보다보니 너무 찐텐으로 긴장하신게 폰 화면 너머 느껴져서 응원하게 된달까요ㅠㅠ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 뱀뱀님이 소원 대표가 되어서 태연이와 컨텐츠 찍는 느낌이에요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 뱀집3은 진짜 태연이 두 번 나오는 걸로 해서 또 하면 안될까요ㅠㅠ??? 뱀집 포레버~~~
진짜 무해한 영상이고 서로 편한분위기라 보기 넘 좋네요ㅎ
Me alegra que PORIFN bambam y taeyon estén hablando cómodamente y ver que bambam cumplió como fan que ella estuviera en el programa los amo a los dos
whenever Taenggooo is around, Bambam's cuteness are showing without him knowing ahhhhckkkk (OMG THERE'S PART 2!?! LET'S GOOOOO)
뱀뱀 순수해보인다
Thank you sooo much Taeyeon for making our BamBam happy, and for being his strength for 15 years now. Ahgases love you!! 
Ask me how many time i watched this ep? I would say around 20 haha, i love these two persons, the chemistry."Let's meet after your debut". Thank you both for debuting & being that beautiful human beings 
미쳤다 무슨 사춘기때 첫사랑 시절로 돌아간거 같아!!그 어떤 멜로드라마보다 더 너무 설렘!!!진짜 좋아하는 사람 게스트로 와서 이렇게 인터뷰 하는 것 정말 너무 설레네요뱀 마음이 너무 이뿌다~~
솔찍단백한   뱀팸 너무좋아~두분우정  보기좋아요
33:24 I can play this on repeat. Bambam's reactions are so real. 37:21 As a SONE, we get how you feel. 
뱀뱀 정말 귀여워
I teared up while watching BamBam tell how her autograph gave him the strength to continue. I really am thankful to her for that - look how far our Bammie has come since then.
Way to go Bam! Now you know how it feels when we see you and the rest of the boys thank you for making our Bam's day and probably life Taeyeon!!
수고많았어 , 대단해 . 앞으로는 더욱더 밝게 지내길 . 너가 한국의 최우선 이다 . 앞으로도 수고하도록 . 제로올림 .
뱀뱀오빠는 성공한 팬이에요! 뱀뱀오빠가 좋아하는 아이돌도 이제 선배이자 동료까지 와우
Me sentí mal tercio en todo el capituló pero que bonitos se ven, la compatibilidad es increíble ️
뱀뱀 ㅋㅋ 멋져태연 오니까 반갑네
Bam saying what he would really want to say to Taeyeon is Thank you is really and sincerely fan coded. Like, I can feel that on a personal level, the chance to say thank you for helping me endure tough times, thank you for giving me strenght with your music, thank you for just being there when nobody was. He's so precious. I'm glad he had the chance to have her on the show!! This is my fav episode until now.
누군가의 팬으로 오래 살아온 사람으로서 이 영상이 너무 설레고 눈물나고 행복해요..뱀님 마음 너무 공감되고 태연언니 넘 설레네요…제 최애를 생각하며 너무 행복하게 잘 봤어요 한번 더 초대해서 주접 더 떨어주세요…
덕질해본 사람으로써 본인이 바라고 바란 내 연예인을 실제로 보는 걸 보고 진짜 내가 다 기뻤음...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
뱀뱀 반응 진짜 너무 귀엽다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ️
좋다 서로 배려하고 높여주고 틈틈이 나오는 격려의 말 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ이걸 기다렸어요!!!
뱀뱀 너무 호감이다♡♡
An older sister caring for a younger brother is a good feeling, warm and cute. Thank you to Taeyeon for caring for our cute baby BamBam
보는 내내 흐뭇함. 계속 웃으면서 보게됨. 뱀뱀님, 축하
Seeing this content makes me happy to see idols have their idols too, all the feelings of Bam as a fanboy are very valid and much felt by kpop fans in general, sometimes unconsciously the existence of idols brings a lot of influence in a fan's life. I'm so happy to see BamBam as Taeyeon's fanboy, thank you Taeyeon for encouraging BamBan to become an idol! We need Taeyeon in Bam House againnn!!
뱀뱀 소원성취 축하
진짜 넘 순수하고 무해하고 귀여운 조합이다 ㅠㅠㅠ 절로 미소 나옴.. 힐링영상임 ㅠㅠ
너무 사랑스러운 가수들이다!!🥹
와 진ㅁ자 이건 정말 찐팬 바이브가 나서 너무 뭉클하고 감동적이다 직접 티켓팅 해서 간다는 게 아이돌이기 전에 소원이라고 하는 게 너무 ㅜㅜ 짖짜 모든  오래된 팬들 한테 감동주는 말인 듯 너무 보기좋다 이 상황
갑자기 손편지를 읽을때 나도 감동해요. 진짜 성공한 펜보이 됐어요. 죽하해요
뱀이 긴장한 것 너무 귀여웡
담주에도 또 볼 수 있다니 뱀집 고마워요 사랑애요 최고
Como fan de Taeyeon, estoy tan feliz por BamBam 🥹
Guys, BamBam is a fan like us, I just love his reactionsI love the fact that he is well recognized even though he is a foreigner there everyone who is a fan of other countries feels represented with him. I love Bambam and everything about it. From a fan from Brazil
Bam's admiration to taeng is so pure. I can feel his heart's extreme happiness and me as a fan would really have same reaction. Imagine, he can get invited but he still wanted to be in the standing section and experience what other fans would normally prefer. You've come a long way Bam.... Taeng also felt that she got a loyal fan who sincerely supports her and truly become an inspiration to become successful  
나도 태연 덕훈데 ㅋㅋㅋ 대리 만족하는 기분 ! 행복해하는 뱀뱀이를 보는 나도 행복
Nossa que divertido ver o Bambam como fan da Taeyeon  essa mulher é maravilhosa mesmo  eu tb ficaria super nervosa perto dela  amei a conversa e já eperando a parte 2 
Truly happy Bam got to have this moment seeing his idol he admires so much and have a 1 on 1 chat with Taeyeon. It is so cute to see his fanboy side and seeing him be so smiley seeing the one person he is the biggest fan of
Bambam's family are the most successful fanboy-fangirls ever!  this episode was so cute! And it's so satisfying that someone finally said yes to sticky rice bc I love papaya salad with rice 
Bambam is so endearing. He seems so sweet. Love that he is over the moon with his fanboying.
Smiling from ear to ear watching Bambam's adorable reaction around Taeyeon...so cute! He is such a massive fan. I can't wait for more episodes...
좋은 사람들이 나누는 대화도 정말 따뜻하고 다정한데 얘기하는 목소리도 너무 따숩고 포근해 사랑 가득한 사람들 너무너무 사랑해요
Damn. I am fanboying along with Bambam. He's at the pinnacle of fanboy success mountain. As a fellow SONE, I am proud of him.
뱀뱀 너무 호감임,,
에이구야 우리 뺌이 귀여워 죽네 ㅋㅋㅋ 꿈이 이뤄진다 ㅋ ️
Bambam en su momento fanboy lo amo 
Thank you so much Bambam for having Taeyeon on your show  Love to see her smile and laugh a lot. I hope Taeyeon gets to contribute on your next song  Fighting!! Will wait for Part 2 and Taeyeon's next visit after this
Bambam is the proof that "All dreams do come true" so thank you Bambam you inspired me so much ️
bambam’s truth  is love how sincere and genuine he’s always been about and with taeyeon! cant wait for part two! thank you bambam and bam house team 🫶
Yasss Taeyeon's voice is my comfort too, I always listen to her songs every time I'm stressed.
I’ll always appreciate anyone who sincerely loves and respects Taeyeon  Glad Taeyeon was a great role model for Bam Bam and he managed to achieve his dream!
dios bambie es tan transparente, recien la empece y senti realmente su nerviosismo y ansiedad jasdjaskd
I'm so happy for our Bammie  as an ahgase since day 1 we all know how he admired Taeyeon and what a big part she is in his career 
뱀집이 1센터 보다 낫다! 담주 화요일 2편도 완전 기대중
Part 2 will come out on Tuesday December 5th instead of Friday guys!! Can't wait!! 
뱀집3 목표: 같이 노래앨범내기뱀뱀 고마워요 태연님나오셔수 뱀집영상보는데  덕분에 뱀뱀 매력을 알게됬어요 두분 다 응원합니다

Thank you BamBam for working hard. I really like this video. You are such a sweet and kind-hearted person. Be honest about your feelings. and honor all artists I hope that you will receive the same response from all of the artist's fans. Keep fighting, BamBam. 
기분 너무너무 좋아지는 영상이다 저런 팬심을 오랫동안 가진 뱀뱀도 진짜 순수하고...팬심이란 뭘까 생각해보게 되는 영상임ㅋㅋㅋㅋ이것도 다 태연이 활동을 잘해줬기 때문일거라 여러모로 맘이 훈훈해지네...
Taeyeon is an angel
언젠가는 한국어 실력이 늘어서 뱀뱀처럼 좋은 외국인이 되기를 바랍니다. 우리나라 많은 분들의 꿈이 아닐까 싶습니다.어쩌면 언젠가는 내 꿈이 이루어질 수도 있겠네요. 브라질의 새로운 팬이 보낸 메시지
Taeyeon, she is like an angel. We want to become like her. She has a beautiful and funny personality. She is pure. Thank you, Taeyeon, because you still give us beautiful songs. Whenever I feel tired, I listen to your songs️️️
I'm so happy for you Bambam and thank you Taeyeon for coming!
Soy fan de Taeyeon por eso vine a ver el vídeo pero también porque e visto en Instagram sobre Bambam y otros invitados, Bambam es muy agradable, sus vídeos también  es muy lindo verlo con Taeyeon 
태연 언니를 초대해 주셔서 감사합니다 뱀집  뱀뱀 씨가 부러워하신 소원 분들 여기 모여주세여!! 
เป็นเกือบ 40 นาที ที่หุบยิ้มไม่ได้เลยขำทั้งพี่แท ทั้งแบม 5555แบมแบมคือตัวแทนหมู่บ้านมาก คอมพลีทชีวิตและเก่งมาก ขนาดเราเจอแค่ในคอนยังใจสั่นไม่ไหว เก่งมากอ้วงงง
Now bambam can understand how his fans feel  love thiiisss episode  he was soooo shy nervous giggly oh my gooddd  indeed he's a successful fanboy 
Their interaction is INSANELY CUTE!!!! How can I resist them 
I guess everybody is so invested and so happy for you and your ultimate goal, Bambam. Look at the views, 1M in 2 frickin days man!
Jajajaja qué bello!!! Que tierno se ve como fanboy!!! Me encanta.. he disfrutado mucho el episodio!! 
같은 탱빠 입장에서 부럽다는 마음을 넘어서서 되게 고마워요 누군가를 오래 좋아하고 응원할 수 있다는건 정말 행복한 일인데 그런 행복을 알게해준 울탱구 너무너무 사랑해
33:30 이런 게 뱀뱀이 말하는 그 시절 우결 태연의 인간적인 모습이 아닐까 싶네요 ㅎㅎ 데뷔초 예능(심지어 친한친구까지도) 보면 저렇게 인간미 있고 귀여운 탱구였는데 어느 순간 악플들과 그런 것들로 저런 모습을 못보다가 다시 예전의 모습을 찾은 것 같아 행복하네요 오래토록 노래해줘 태연아!
Hearing Taeyeon eonni speak her mind like this...  Bambam oppa! Thank you for making Taengoo eonni talk to her heart's content and giving her genuine laughs. 밤집 성공!! 
탱구 너무 이쁘다
Muy feliz por bambam logro lo que más anhelaba 
태연이피뱀집을 봐서 저는 울고 웃어요 🥹
뱀뱀이가 뱀이인지 나인지.. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진심 어린 말들을 해줘서 너무 예뻐요 ㅠㅠ 탱구가 많이 힘이 되었을 거 같아 고마워요 뱀뱀:)
I love taeyeon and she looks like such a warm hearted person 
Un fanboy que siente que va a morir por todo lo que dice su crush. Bello Bam Bam 
태연 뱀집 백만뷰 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 어맛 보고있는 사이에 인기 급상승 #9 !!!!!!!!
I’m so sad that Bam did read some unkind post on X about him mention of Taeyeon. As a SONE, I just find him so cute when expressing his love to our idol, i can relate to him. I’m glad that Taeyeon did tell him that she happy with it, and i can tell most SONEs feel the same way 
Bambam being the ultimate successful fan is so cute to watch! Taeyon is a goddess, Bambam is such a sweet little Thai Prince trying to properly make tribute  
아 누군가의 팬으로써 뱀뱀 마음 너무 이해된다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 수명 짧아진댘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 주접 너무 귀엽고 태연 너무 예뻐,,,🥹
내가 뱀뱀도 아닌데 태연한테 뭉쿨하고 고맙고 눈물나네
I'm glad to be a BamBam's fanclub. Because his love is stable  does not change easily . Thank you Taeyeon Noona, she' s very kind to BamBam. 
Happy for you, BamBam. I'm also SONE and i feel you. Taeyeon.. you're so gergeous
I dont know why but I always think that Taeyeon just need a person like Bam in her life - the funny, honest and warm guy who makes her feel loved unconditionally. Hope that Bam will always stand by her side.
뱀뱀이 넘 귀엽넹 ㅋㅋ태연도 잘 받아주고 ㅋㅋ
태연씨의 오랜된 팬으로서 한마디!! : 이번 앨범 최고예요~ 정말 수록곡까지 너무 좋아서 매일 듣고 있네요. 다만 한가지 아쉬운 점은 좀 더 다양한 콘텐츠에서 볼 수 있었으면 좋겠어요. 오늘 이렇게 봐서 너무 좋았네요. 항상 응원합니다!
I havent be able to watch most episodes of Bam's show lately but as soon as I saw Taeyeon I couldnt stop smiling because it made me so happy for Bam.
뱀집 볼때마다 파파야를 장 바구니에 담고 있어요. 솜탐 참 좋아하는데, 뱀뱀이 만든 건 어떤 맛일까??오늘 둘다 너무 사랑스럽고 예쁘다…
Unfortunately this episode was way to short - Taeyeon is such a wonderful person and you barely scratched the surface of her personality thee are times when I can't sleep, so I put on her music and soon I am able to get to sleep, it is so relaxing and soothing to listen to and or watch her sing, she really loves to sing and give people inspiration ---
why I'm smiling while watching the whole EP ahah seeing shy Bambam happy also makes me feel better, glad to see them
역시 탱구 조련의 원조
I fell in love with BamBam with this episode, it's official lol. First, Taeyeon is also my ultimate (girl) bias, so I totally understand his fanboying because I fangirl just as much for her lol. Second, he was sooooooo respectful, kind, careful, and caring the entire episode. He literally made her feel so comfortable, even when she was embarrassed and shy. As an INFJ, let me tell you, it's TOUGH to make us feel that safe and comfortable when we are so naturally reserved and uncomfortable with compliments (even though we love it deep inside). BamBam is just so darn cute and definitely, manly (at least, what I perceive it as). I would love to have a partner like him - he seems like such an honest, genuine, caring, and loveable guy. I love that he respected her in all aspects and made sure she felt comfortable at all times. Gah, I love him.
역시 탱프제 언니 센스 매너 찢었다 
I teared up while hearing him talk about how Taeyeon influenced him a lot in his trainee days. It makes me feel so emotional and happy that Bambam gets to meet his idol, finally! What a successful fanboy, and honestly I probably would react worse than him if I were to meet THE Taeyeon.
하 태연 역시 웃겨...화법 너무 좋아
Lo mucho que este episodio llenó mi corazón . Me encanta ver a mis favs conociendo a sus favs es como verles cumplir sus sueños

I'm really happy for Bam. I can see how over the moon he is because finally Taeyon is there. He is really sincere.
태연이 벌써 나올줄은 JYP보다 더 긴장했는데? ㅋㅋ 예능에서 보다가 부끄러워하는 태연 오랜만에 보네 ㅋ 노래할땐 요즘 성숙해 보였는데 아직도 귀엽네
At first Taeyeon look shy because bambam keep praise her..But in the end when she's already comfortable she's the one keep teasing bambam haha so cute 
가위바위보를 어떻게 혼자서 하지? 나 엄청 웃었어 배 터질거 같아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이번 편 너무 재밌당 ㅎㅎ

His eyes become smaller at the end of the show because of all the energy he has used up being all excited and nervous because of Taeyeon. He's so precious!
I’m so happy for Bambam. I can see why he admires her so much. Her music gave him strength and motivation during his tough time. I would feel grateful forever too if I were him. Can’t wait for part 2!
omg i love this interactions so much bambam you're so adorable
Bambam’s the type of guy who seems to be nonchalant but is actually observant. He’s the type to surprisingly give you things that you like at moments you don’t expect He’s such a simp for taengoo
33:23 Sudden impact!35:08 New decision making method and Taeyeon's cute reactionThis is such a funny episode but also relatable as someone who got to know SNSD through Gee and Taeyeon through If
영상이 왜 안끝날까요ㅠㅠㅠ 나 뱀집만 계속 보고있자나ㅠㅠㅠ 좋은 사람 옆엔 좋은 사람이 있다는게 맞나봐맞나봐 탱구랑 뱀님 너무 무해하구 사랑스러버ㅠㅠㅠ
Esperando ansiosamente pela segunda parte 
真的佩服 BamBam可以勇敢說出這些，好真心的付出，說出他的喜歡，因為Tae而努力成功的故事，我聽了都忍不住想哭了。很感動，還說了一定要自己買票去看演唱會站在VIP區為她加油，恭喜你，很成功的SONE.

너무 순수해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 ㅠㅠ 귀엽다
I have been Taeyeon fan for very long time and I have never seen that kinds of cuteness from Taeyeon. It is so pure and she is very comfortable at his place. Thank you BamBam for making Taeyeon happy and you represent of all fans especially to Fanboy. 
Was waiting for this to happen!!I was at work when I got the news of Taeyeon's visit and can't wait to go home to watch this episode..Bam really became a successful fan when Taeyeon said "I like you", Damn! I will die if I heard that..Anyway, congrats Bam and thank you for giving us a chance to see an episode like this, can't wait for part 2!
Love you Bambam, thanks for loving Taengoo~~
