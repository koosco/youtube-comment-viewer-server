To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressed about gets better  May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion And may peace and calmness fill your life
The very start set me in a perfect mood, and brought me back to one of my fav Ghibli's Spirited Away, and how uplifting and full of promise I saw at the start of my day. Even though things got crazy I'm ready to tackle those challenges.
What a beautiful piece of music! I feel so refreshed and rejuvenated after listening to it
Thank you, the music relaxes me and helps me a lot to practice 
Me encanta estudiar con este estilo de música 
Embarking on a magical journey with this 2-hour Ghibli music masterpiece!  The enchanting melodies create a perfect backdrop for healing, study, work, or a peaceful night's sleep. It's like being transported to the whimsical worlds of Ghibli Studio, where every note carries the spirit of adventure. Gratitude to the creators for providing such a beautiful soundtrack that brings joy and tranquility to every moment. 
To those out there stressing about their homework-as I am as well- take deep breathes and take breaks when needed. Your mental health is very important so please take care of yourselves!
Me transporta al mundo Ghibli, perfecto para trabajar o simplemente desconectar... gracias.
A heartfelt thank you to our fantastic audience! Your support fuels our passion for jazz. May our music accompany you in your moments of relaxation and joy!
Me gusta mucho escuchar esta música, suena muy relajante.
Más que solo tranquilizarme, esta música sigue trayéndome recuerdos, y cuando menos me doy cuenta, mi cara está llena de lágrimas.
I love Gilbi Movies and all their simple content stories are amazing....these background musics remind me of the peacefulness that I had back in time

I love this music
저는 매일 아침 이 음악을 틀어 유치원생들을 교실로 환영합니다. 수업이 시작되기를 기다리며 조용히 들어와 연주할 때 음악은 평온함을 가져다줍니다. 감사합니다.
外人さんのコメントが多い事が嬉しい！この美しい音楽が世界にも評価されてて嬉しい。
배경들이 너무 예뻐요ㅠㅠ
好聽
와우 이것은 너무 편안하고 숙제를 하거나 글을 쓰는 데 전혀 방해가 되지 않습니다. 좋아!

謝謝分享 很讚
thanks! this helped me do my homework.
Good song
Anyone who knows how could i get the piano scores for this list of pieces?
good good nice songs
可以讓心情平穩真是一首好歌
听到这种音乐我是没有办法放松的，因为弹得太好了，所以总是会集中精力去听是怎么弹，怎么编曲的，越听越心累
聞いて学ぶのが好きです
지브리 음악은 편안한 느낌을 줘서 너무 좋고 음악을 들을때에 꼭 환상의 세계에 가있는 듯한 기분이에요.. 일본은 음악을 정말 잘만드는 나라에용. ㅠ
"A Town with a View of the Sea" bears strong striking resemblance to "Hometown Domina" (legend of mana).
very beautfiul!!!
If anyone's speaking love in Japanese this is it.
Relaxing
I love Ghibli music
聴きながら、映像を眺めていると、これらを創った人たちが日本にあって欲しい、理想の風景への願いを感じた気がする。他の国にあってもいいけど、でもできるなら日本に…あるいは伝わる人の身近にありますように。そう聴こえて、見えています。
Personal timepin: 1:02:00
마치 마법의 나라로 가는 티켓과 같습니다.
“People speak of hope as if it’s this delicate, ephemeral thing made of whispers and spider’s webs. It’s not. Hope has dirt on her face, blood on her knuckles, the grit of cobblestone in her hair, and just spat out a tooth as she rises for another go.”  This year may have beaten many of us down, but it’s not over.
Very nice
NICEE!!!
i like it
睡着了又醒了，真不错
thank you!
힐링 그잡채..

i lve this it is beautiful
Nice
Is this last song from the song "Take Me Home, Country Roads" `? Its sounds so similar
Idea is great, but I get lots of adds (almost every song), which totaly destroy the atmosphere.
era p me ajudar a estudar, mas eu me estresso isso sim
Wish you have a golden heart, my unseen and unknown friend!
Dritter Song bei "Mein Nachbar Totoro" ist 1:1 "Take Me Home, Country Roads" 
ジブリの世界行ってみたいなぁ、🥹
Is the part after 1:45:24 the song "TakeMeHome, Country Roads" ？
Gorgeous

nice
Thank you,
The music here is really good. We also opened a similar channel. The pictures we drew are played along with the music. come over.
GOOD
01:42:45 is straight-up a piano rendition of "Take Me Home, Country Roads" by John Denver.
好听，不过不知道中途会不会跳出广告
Nghe "tên sự sống"  tự nhiên cảm giác như làm mất gì đó ...
Thanks
